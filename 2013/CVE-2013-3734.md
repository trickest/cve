### Description

The Embedded Jopr component in JBoss Application Server includes the cleartext datasource password in unspecified HTML responses, which might allow (1) man-in-the-middle attackers to obtain sensitive information by leveraging failure to use SSL or (2) attackers to obtain sensitive information by reading the HTML source code.  NOTE: the vendor says that this does not cross a trust boundary and that it is recommended best-practice that SSL is configured for the administrative console
