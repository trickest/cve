### Description

The Java Runtime Environment (JRE) component in Oracle Java SE 7 Update 17 and earlier, 6 Update 43 and earlier, and 5.0 Update 41 and earlier; and OpenJDK 6 and 7; allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via vectors related to AWT, as demonstrated by Ben Murphy during a Pwn2Own competition at CanSecWest 2013.  NOTE: the previous information is from the April 2013 CPU. Oracle has not commented on claims from another vendor that this issue is related to invocation of the system class loader by the sun.awt.datatransfer.ClassLoaderObjectInputStream class, which allows remote attackers to bypass Java sandbox restrictions.
