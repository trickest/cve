### Description

The default configuration of EMC RSA BSAFE Toolkits and RSA Data Protection Manager (DPM) 20130918 uses the Dual Elliptic Curve Deterministic Random Bit Generation (Dual_EC_DRBG) algorithm, which makes it easier for context-dependent attackers to defeat cryptographic protection mechanisms by leveraging unspecified "security concerns," aka the ESA-2013-068 issue.  NOTE: this issue has been SPLIT from CVE-2007-6755 because the vendor announcement did not state a specific technical rationale for a change in the algorithm; thus, CVE cannot reach a conclusion that a CVE-2007-6755 concern was the reason, or one of the reasons, for this change.
