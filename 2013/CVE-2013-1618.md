### Description

The TLS implementation in Opera before 12.13 does not properly consider timing side-channel attacks on a MAC check operation during the processing of malformed CBC padding, which allows remote attackers to conduct distinguishing attacks and plaintext-recovery attacks via statistical analysis of timing data for crafted packets, a related issue to CVE-2013-0169.
