### Description

The TLS implementation in GnuTLS before 2.12.23, 3.0.x before 3.0.28, and 3.1.x before 3.1.7 does not properly consider timing side-channel attacks on a noncompliant MAC check operation during the processing of malformed CBC padding, which allows remote attackers to conduct distinguishing attacks and plaintext-recovery attacks via statistical analysis of timing data for crafted packets, a related issue to CVE-2013-0169.
