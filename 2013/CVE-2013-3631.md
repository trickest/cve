### Description

NAS4Free 9.1.0.1.804 and earlier allows remote authenticated users to execute arbitrary PHP code via a request to exec.php, aka the "Advanced | Execute Command" feature.  NOTE: this issue might not be a vulnerability, since it appears to be part of legitimate, intentionally-exposed functionality by the developer and is allowed within the intended security policy.
