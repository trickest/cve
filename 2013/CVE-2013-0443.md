### Description

Unspecified vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) component in Oracle Java SE 7 through Update 11, 6 through Update 38, 5.0 through Update 38, and 1.4.2_40 and earlier, and OpenJDK 6 and 7, allows remote attackers to affect confidentiality and integrity via vectors related to JSSE.  NOTE: the previous information is from the February 2013 CPU. Oracle has not commented on claims from another vendor that this issue is related to incorrect validation of Diffie-Hellman keys, which allows remote attackers to conduct a "small subgroup attack" to force the use of weak session keys or obtain sensitive information about the private key.
