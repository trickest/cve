### Description

Unspecified vulnerability in the Oracle GoldenGate Veridata component in Oracle Fusion Middleware 3.0.0.4 allows remote attackers to affect availability via unknown vectors related to Server.  NOTE: the previous information was obtained from the January 2011 CPU.  Oracle has not commented on claims from a reliable third party researcher that this is a buffer overflow via a crafted XML soap request and a value that does not contain the expected 0x20 terminator character.
