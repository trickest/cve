### Description

The FieldList ActiveX control in the Microsoft Access Wizard Controls in ACCWIZ.dll in Microsoft Office Access 2003 SP3 does not properly interact with the memory-access approach used by Internet Explorer and Office during instantiation, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (memory corruption) via an HTML document that references this control along with crafted persistent storage data, aka "ACCWIZ.dll Uninitialized Variable Vulnerability."
