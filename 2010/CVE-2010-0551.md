### Description

HTTP authentication implementation in Geo++ GNCASTER 1.4.0.7 and earlier allows remote attackers to read authentication headers of other users via a large request with an incorrect authentication attempt, which includes sensitive memory in the response.  NOTE: this is referred to as a "memory leak" by some sources, but is better characterized as "memory disclosure."
