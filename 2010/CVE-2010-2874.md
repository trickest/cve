### Description

Unspecified vulnerability in Adobe Shockwave Player before 11.5.8.612 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via unknown vectors that trigger memory corruption.  NOTE: due to conflicting information and use of the same CVE identifier by the vendor, ZDI, and TippingPoint, it is not clear whether this issue is related to use of an uninitialized pointer, an incorrect pointer offset calculation, or both.
