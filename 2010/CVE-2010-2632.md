### Description

Unspecified vulnerability in the FTP Server in Oracle Solaris 8, 9, 10, and 11 Express allows remote attackers to affect availability. NOTE: the previous information was obtained from the January 2011 CPU. Oracle has not commented on claims from a reliable researcher that this is an issue in the glob implementation in libc that allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (CPU and memory consumption) via crafted glob expressions that do not match any pathnames.
