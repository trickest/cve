### Description

Unspecified vulnerability in the 2D component in Oracle Java SE and Java for Business 6 Update 21, 5.0 Update 25, and 1.4.2_27 allows remote attackers to affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability via unknown vectors.  NOTE: the previous information was obtained from the October 2010 CPU.  Oracle has not commented on claims from a reliable researcher that this is an integer overflow that triggers memory corruption via large values in a subsample of a JPEG image, related to JPEGImageWriter.writeImage in the imageio API.
