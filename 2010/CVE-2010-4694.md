### Description

Buffer overflow in gif2png.c in gif2png 2.5.3 and earlier might allow context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or have unspecified other impact via a GIF file that contains many images, leading to long extensions such as .p100 for PNG output files, as demonstrated by a CGI program that launches gif2png, a different vulnerability than CVE-2009-5018.
