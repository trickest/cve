### Description

Multiple stack-based buffer overflows in DATAC RealWin 2.0 Build 6.1.8.10 and earlier allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a long (1) SCPC_INITIALIZE, (2) SCPC_INITIALIZE_RF, or (3) SCPC_TXTEVENT packet. NOTE: it was later reported that 1.06 is also affected by one of these requests.
