### Description

Oracle Mojarra 1.2_14 and 2.0.2, as used in IBM WebSphere Application Server, Caucho Resin, and other applications, does not properly handle an unencrypted view state, which allows remote attackers to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks or execute arbitrary Expression Language (EL) statements via vectors that involve modifying the serialized view object.
