### Description

The wake_futex_pi function in kernel/futex.c in the Linux kernel before 2.6.33-rc7 does not properly handle certain unlock operations for a Priority Inheritance (PI) futex, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (OOPS) and possibly have unspecified other impact via vectors involving modification of the futex value from user space.
