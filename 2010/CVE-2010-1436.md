### Description

gfs2 in the Linux kernel 2.6.18, and possibly other versions, does not properly handle when the gfs2_quota struct occupies two separate pages, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (kernel panic) via certain manipulations that cause an out-of-bounds write, as demonstrated by writing from an ext3 file system to a gfs2 file system.
