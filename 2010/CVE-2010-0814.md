### Description

The Microsoft Access Wizard Controls in ACCWIZ.dll in Microsoft Office Access 2003 SP3 and 2007 SP1 and SP2 do not properly interact with the memory-allocation approach used by Internet Explorer during instantiation, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a web site that references multiple ActiveX controls, as demonstrated by the ImexGrid and FieldList controls, aka "Access ActiveX Control Vulnerability."
