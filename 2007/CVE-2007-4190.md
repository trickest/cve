### Description

CRLF injection vulnerability in Joomla! before 1.0.13 (aka Sunglow) allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary HTTP headers and probably conduct HTTP response splitting attacks via CRLF sequences in the url parameter.  NOTE: this can be leveraged for cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.  NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third party information.
