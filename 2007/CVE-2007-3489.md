### Description

Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in pop/WizU.html in the management interface in Check Point VPN-1 Edge X Embedded NGX 7.0.33x on the Check Point VPN-1 UTM Edge allows remote attackers to perform privileged actions as administrators, as demonstrated by a request with the swuuser and swupass parameters, which adds an administrator account.  NOTE: the CSRF attack has no timing window because there is no logout capability in the management interface.
