### Description

Multiple buffer overflows in Firebird 2.1 allow attackers to trigger memory corruption and possibly have other unspecified impact via certain input processed by (1) config\ConfigFile.cpp or (2) msgs\check_msgs.epp.  NOTE: if ConfigFile.cpp reads a configuration file with restrictive permissions, then the ConfigFile.cpp vector may not cross privilege boundaries and perhaps should not be included in CVE.
