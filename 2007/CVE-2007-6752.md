### Description

Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in Drupal 7.12 and earlier allows remote attackers to hijack the authentication of arbitrary users for requests that end a session via the user/logout URI.  NOTE: the vendor disputes the significance of this issue, by considering the "security benefit against platform complexity and performance impact" and concluding that a change to the logout behavior is not planned because "for most sites it is not worth the trade-off.
