### Description

The FTP Server in Cisco IOS 11.3 through 12.4 does not properly check user authorization, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code, and have other impact including reading startup-config, as demonstrated by a crafted MKD command that involves access to a VTY device and overflows a buffer, aka bug ID CSCek55259.
