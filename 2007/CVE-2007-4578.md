### Description

Sophos Anti-Virus for Windows and for Unix/Linux before 2.48.0 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted UPX packed file, resulting from an "integer cast around".  NOTE: as of 20070828, the vendor says this is a DoS and the researcher says this allows code execution, but the researcher is reliable.
