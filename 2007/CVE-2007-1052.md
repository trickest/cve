### Description

PHP remote file inclusion vulnerability in index.php in PBLang (PBL) 4.60 and earlier allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the dbpath parameter, a different vector than CVE-2006-5062.  NOTE: this issue has been disputed by a reliable third party for 4.65, stating that the dbpath variable is initialized in an included file that is created upon installation
