### Description

Integer overflow in Adobe Flash Player 9.0.115.0 and earlier, and 8.0.39.0 and earlier, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted SWF file with a negative Scene Count value, which passes a signed comparison, is used as an offset of a NULL pointer, and triggers a buffer overflow.
