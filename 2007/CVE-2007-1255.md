### Description

Unrestricted file upload vulnerability in admin.bbcode.php in Connectix Boards 0.7 and earlier allows remote authenticated administrators to execute arbitrary PHP code by uploading a crafted GIF smiley image with a .php extension via the uploadimage parameter to admin.php, which can be later accessed via a direct request for the file in smileys/.  NOTE: this can be leveraged with a separate SQL injection issue for remote unauthenticated attacks.
