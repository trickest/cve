### Description

cp.php in DeluxeBB 1.09 does not verify that the membercookie parameter corresponds to the authenticated member during a profile update, which allows remote authenticated users to change the e-mail addresses of arbitrary accounts via a modified membercookie parameter, a different vector than CVE-2006-4078.  NOTE: this can be leveraged for administrative access by requesting password-reset e-mail through a lostpw action to misc.php.
