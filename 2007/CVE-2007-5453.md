### Description

Multiple eval injection vulnerabilities in Php-Stats 0.1.9.2 allow remote authenticated administrators to execute arbitrary code by writing PHP sequences to the php-stats-options record in the _options table, which is used in an eval function call by (1) admin.php, (2) click.php, (3) download.php, and unspecified other files, as demonstrated by modifying _options through a backup restore action in admin.php.
