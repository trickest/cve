### Description

Directory traversal vulnerability in the JetAudio.Interface.1 ActiveX control in JetFlExt.dll in jetAudio 7.0.3 Basic and 7.0.3.3016 allows remote attackers to create or overwrite arbitrary local files via a ..\ (dot dot backslash) in the second argument to the DownloadFromMusicStore method.  NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third party information.  NOTE: this can be leveraged for code execution by overwriting JetAudio.exe, which is launched by the control after completion of the method call.
