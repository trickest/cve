### Description

PHP remote file inclusion vulnerability in index.php in the Virii Info 1.10 and earlier module for Xoops allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the xoopsConfig[root_path] parameter. NOTE: the issue has been disputed by a reliable third party, stating that the application's checkSuperglobals function defends against the attack
