### Description

Interpretation conflict in WinSCP before 4.0.4 allows remote attackers to perform arbitrary file transfers with a remote server via file-transfer commands in the final portion of a (1) scp, and possibly a (2) sftp or (3) ftp, URL, as demonstrated by a URL specifying login to the remote server with a username of scp, which is interpreted as an HTTP scheme name by the protocol handler in a web browser, but is interpreted as a username by WinSCP.  NOTE: this is related to an incomplete fix for CVE-2006-3015.
