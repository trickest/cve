### Description

Directory traversal vulnerability in language.php in VerliAdmin 0.3 and earlier, when magic_quotes_gpc is disabled, allows remote attackers to include and execute arbitrary local files via a .. (dot dot) in the lang cookie, as demonstrated by injecting PHP sequences into an Apache HTTP Server log file, which is then included by language.php.
