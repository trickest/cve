### Description

admin/administrator.php in Adult Script 1.6 and earlier sends a redirect to the web browser but does not exit, which allows remote attackers to bypass authentication and obtain administrative credentials via a direct request.  NOTE: this can be leveraged for arbitrary code execution through a request to admin/videolinks_view.php.
