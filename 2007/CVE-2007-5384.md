### Description

Multiple cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities in the Thomson/Alcatel SpeedTouch 7G router, as used for the BT Home Hub 6.2.6.B and earlier, allow remote attackers to perform actions as administrators via unspecified POST requests, as demonstrated by enabling an inbound remote-assistance HTTPS session on TCP port 51003. NOTE: an authentication bypass can be leveraged to exploit this in the absence of an existing administrative session.  NOTE: SpeedTouch 780 might also be affected by some of these issues.
