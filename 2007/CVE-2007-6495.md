### Description

inc_newuser.asp in Hosting Controller 6.1 Hot fix 3.3 and earlier allows remote authenticated users to change the permissions of directories named (1) db, (2) www, (3) Special, and (4) log at arbitrary locations under the web root via a modified Dirroot parameter in an AddUser action to accounts/AccountActions.asp.  NOTE: this can be leveraged for remote code execution by changing the permissions of \Forum\db, which is configured for execution of ASP scripts with administrative privileges, and then uploading a script to \Forum\db.
