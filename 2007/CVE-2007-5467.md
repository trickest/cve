### Description

Integer overflow in eXtremail 2.1.1 and earlier allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service, and possibly execute arbitrary code, via a long USER command containing "%s" sequences to the pop3 port (110/tcp), which are expanded to "%%s" before being used in the memmove function, possibly due to an incomplete fix for CVE-2001-1078.
