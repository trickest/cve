### Description

Integer overflow in the ISC dhcpd 3.0.x before 3.0.7 and 3.1.x before 3.1.1; and the DHCP server in EMC VMware Workstation before 5.5.5 Build 56455 and 6.x before 6.0.1 Build 55017, Player before 1.0.5 Build 56455 and Player 2 before 2.0.1 Build 55017, ACE before 1.0.3 Build 54075 and ACE 2 before 2.0.1 Build 55017, and Server before 1.0.4 Build 56528; allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon crash) or execute arbitrary code via a malformed DHCP packet with a large dhcp-max-message-size that triggers a stack-based buffer overflow, related to servers configured to send many DHCP options to clients.
