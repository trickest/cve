### Description

Dokploy is a free, self-hostable Platform as a Service (PaaS). In versions prior to 0.26.6, a critical command injection vulnerability exists in Dokploy's WebSocket endpoint `/docker-container-terminal`. The `containerId` and `activeWay` parameters are directly interpolated into shell commands without sanitization, allowing authenticated attackers to execute arbitrary commands on the host server. Version 0.26.6 fixes the issue.
