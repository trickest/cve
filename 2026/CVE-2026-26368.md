### Description

eNet SMART HOME server 2.2.1 and 2.3.1 contains a missing authorization vulnerability in the resetUserPassword JSON-RPC method that allows any authenticated low-privileged user (UG_USER) to reset the password of arbitrary accounts, including those in the UG_ADMIN and UG_SUPER_ADMIN groups, without supplying the current password or having sufficient privileges. By sending a crafted JSON-RPC request to /jsonrpc/management, an attacker can overwrite existing credentials, resulting in direct account takeover with full administrative access and persistent privilege escalation.
