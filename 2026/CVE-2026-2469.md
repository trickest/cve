### Description

Versions of the package directorytree/imapengine before 1.22.3 are vulnerable to Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection') via the id() function in ImapConnection.php due to improperly escaping user input before including it in IMAP ID commands. This allows attackers to read or delete victim's emails, terminate the victim's session or execute any valid IMAP command on victim's mailbox by including quote characters " or CRLF sequences \r\n in the input.
