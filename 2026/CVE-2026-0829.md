### Description

The Frontend File Manager Plugin WordPress plugin through 23.5 allows unauthenticated users to send emails through the site without any security checks. This lets attackers use the WordPress site as an open relay for spam or phishing emails to anyone. Attackers can also guess file IDs to access and share uploaded files without permission, exposing sensitive information.
