### Description

Panda3D versions up to and including 1.10.16 deploy-stub contains a denial of service vulnerability due to unbounded stack allocation. The deploy-stub executable allocates argv_copy and argv_copy2 using alloca() based directly on the attacker-controlled argc value without validation. Supplying a large number of command-line arguments can exhaust stack space and propagate uninitialized stack memory into Python interpreter initialization, resulting in a reliable crash and undefined behavior.
