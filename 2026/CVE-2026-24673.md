### Description

The Open eClass platform (formerly known as GUnet eClass) is a complete course management system. Prior to version 4.2, a file upload validation bypass vulnerability allows attackers to upload files with prohibited extensions by embedding them inside ZIP archives and extracting them using the application’s built-in decompression functionality. This issue has been patched in version 4.2.
