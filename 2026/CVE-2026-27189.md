### Description

OpenSift is an AI study tool that sifts through large datasets using semantic search and generative AI. Versions 1.1.2-alpha and below, use non-atomic and insufficiently synchronized local JSON persistence flows, potentially causing concurrent operations to lose updates or corrupt local state across sessions/study/quiz/flashcard/wellness/auth stores. This issue has been fixed in version 1.1.3-alpha.
