### Description

VB-Audio Voicemeeter, Voicemeeter Banana, and Voicemeeter Potato (versions ending in 1.1.1.9, 2.1.1.9, and 3.1.1.9 and earlier, respectively), as well as VB-Audio Matrix and Matrix Coconut (versions ending in 1.0.2.2 and 2.0.2.2 and earlier, respectively), contain a vulnerability in their virtual audio drivers (vbvoicemeetervaio64*.sys, vbmatrixvaio64*.sys, vbaudio_vmauxvaio*.sys, vbaudio_vmvaio*.sys, and vbaudio_vmvaio3*.sys). The drivers allocate non-paged pool and map it into user space, where a length value associated with the allocation is exposed and can be modified by an unprivileged local attacker. On subsequent IOCTL handling, the corrupted length is used directly as the IoAllocateMdl length argument without adequate integrity checks before building and mapping the MDL, which can cause a kernel crash (BSoD), typically PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA. This flaw allows a local user to trigger a denial-of-service on affected Windows systems.
