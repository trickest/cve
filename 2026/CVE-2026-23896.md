### Description

immich is a high performance self-hosted photo and video management solution. Prior to version 2.5.0, API keys can escalate their own permissions by calling the update endpoint, allowing a low-privilege API key to grant itself full administrative access to the system. Version 2.5.0 fixes the issue.
