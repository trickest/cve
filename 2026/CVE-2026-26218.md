### Description

newbee-mall includes pre-seeded administrator accounts in its database initialization script. These accounts are provisioned with a predictable default password. Deployments that initialize or reset the database using the provided schema and fail to change the default administrative credentials may allow unauthenticated attackers to log in as an administrator and gain full administrative control of the application.
