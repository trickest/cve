### Description

SiYuan is self-hosted, open source personal knowledge management software. Prior to 3.5.4-dev2, a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in SiYuan Note. The application does not sanitize uploaded SVG files. If a user uploads and views a malicious SVG file (e.g., imported from an untrusted source), arbitrary JavaScript code is executed in the context of their authenticated session. This vulnerability is fixed in 3.5.4-dev2.
