### Description

Sliver is a command and control framework that uses a custom Wireguard netstack. Prior to 1.6.11, a path traversal in the website content subsystem lets an authenticated operator read arbitrary files on the Sliver server host. This is an authenticated path traversal / arbitrary file read issue, and it can expose credentials, configs, and keys. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.6.11.
