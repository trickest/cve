### Description

Multiple unrestricted file upload vulnerabilities in the (1) twikidraw (action/twikidraw.py) and (2) anywikidraw (action/anywikidraw.py) actions in MoinMoin before 1.9.6 allow remote authenticated users with write permissions to execute arbitrary code by uploading a file with an executable extension, then accessing it via a direct request to the file in an unspecified directory, as exploited in the wild in July 2012.
