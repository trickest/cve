### Description

Google Chrome 17.0.963.66 and earlier allows remote attackers to bypass the sandbox protection mechanism by leveraging access to a sandboxed process, as demonstrated by VUPEN during a Pwn2Own competition at CanSecWest 2012.  NOTE: the primary affected product may be clarified later; it was not identified by the researcher, who reportedly stated "it really doesn't matter if it's third-party code."
