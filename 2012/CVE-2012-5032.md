### Description

The Flex-VPN load-balancing feature in the ipsec-ikev2 implementation in Cisco IOS before 15.1(1)SY3 does not require authentication, which allows remote attackers to trigger the forwarding of VPN traffic to an attacker-controlled destination, or the discarding of this traffic, by arranging for an arbitrary device to become a cluster member, aka Bug ID CSCub93641.
