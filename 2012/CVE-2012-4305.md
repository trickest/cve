### Description

Unspecified vulnerability in the JavaFX component in Oracle Java SE JavaFX 2.2.4 and earlier allows remote attackers to affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability via unknown vectors, a different vulnerability than other CVEs listed in the February 2013 CPU.  NOTE: the previous information is from the February 2013 CPU. Oracle has not commented on claims from a third party that the issue allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via vectors related to an "invalid type cast" and exposed native methods in the T2KGlyph class.
