### Description

The crypt_des (aka DES-based crypt) function in FreeBSD before 9.0-RELEASE-p2, as used in PHP, PostgreSQL, and other products, does not process the complete cleartext password if this password contains a 0x80 character, which makes it easier for context-dependent attackers to obtain access via an authentication attempt with an initial substring of the intended password, as demonstrated by a Unicode password.
