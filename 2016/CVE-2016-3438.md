NOTE: the previous information is from the April 2016 CPU. Oracle has not commented on third-party claims that that this issue involves multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities, which allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via three unspecified parameters in an unknown JSP file.
