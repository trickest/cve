### Description

PHP through 5.6.27 and 7.x through 7.0.12 mishandles property modification during __wakeup processing, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted serialized data, as demonstrated by Exception::__toString with DateInterval::__wakeup.
