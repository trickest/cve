### Description

Heap-based buffer overflow in the wcnss_wlan_write function in drivers/net/wireless/wcnss/wcnss_wlan.c in the wcnss_wlan device driver for the Linux kernel 3.x, as used in Qualcomm Innovation Center (QuIC) Android contributions for MSM devices and other products, allows attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact by writing to /dev/wcnss_wlan with an unexpected amount of data.
