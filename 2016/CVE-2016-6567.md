### Description

SHDesigns' Resident Download Manager provides firmware update capabilities for Rabbit 2000/3000 CPU boards, which according to the reporter may be used in some industrial control and embedded applications. The Resident Download Manager does not verify that the firmware is authentic before executing code and deploying the firmware to devices. A remote attacker with the ability to send UDP traffic to the device may be able to execute arbitrary code on the device. According to SHDesigns' website, the Resident Download Manager and other Rabbit Tools have been discontinued since June 2011.
