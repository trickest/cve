### Description

The auto-provisioning mechanism in the Grandstream Wave app 1.0.1.26 and earlier for Android and Grandstream Video IP phones allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof provisioning data and consequently modify device functionality, obtain sensitive information from system logs, and have unspecified other impact by leveraging failure to use an HTTPS session for downloading configuration files from http://fm.grandstream.com/gs/.
