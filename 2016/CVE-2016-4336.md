### Description

An exploitable out-of-bounds write exists in the Bzip2 parsing of the Lexmark Perspective Document Filters conversion functionality. A crafted Bzip2 document can lead to a stack-based buffer overflow causing an out-of-bounds write which under the right circumstance could potentially be leveraged by an attacker to gain arbitrary code execution.
