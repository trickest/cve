### Description

The LIST_POISON feature in include/linux/poison.h in the Linux kernel before 4.3, as used in Android 6.0.1 before 2016-03-01, does not properly consider the relationship to the mmap_min_addr value, which makes it easier for attackers to bypass a poison-pointer protection mechanism by triggering the use of an uninitialized list entry, aka Android internal bug 26186802, a different vulnerability than CVE-2015-3636.
