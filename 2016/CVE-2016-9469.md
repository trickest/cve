### Description

Multiple versions of GitLab expose a dangerous method to any authenticated user that could lead to the deletion of all Issue and MergeRequest objects on a GitLab instance.

A fix was included in versions 8.14.3, 8.13.8, and 8.12.11, which were released on December 5th 2016 at 3:59 PST. The GitLab versions vulnerable to this are 8.13.0, 8.13.0-ee, 8.13.1, 8.13.1-ee, 8.13.2, 8.13.2-ee, 8.13.3, 8.13.3-ee, 8.13.4, 8.13.4-ee, 8.13.5, 8.13.5-ee, 8.13.6, 8.13.6-ee, 8.13.7, 8.14.0, 8.14.0-ee, 8.14.1, 8.14.2, and 8.14.2-ee.
