### Description

Multiple integer overflows in libXpm before 3.5.12, when a program requests parsing XPM extensions on a 64-bit platform, allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds write) or execute arbitrary code via (1) the number of extensions or (2) their concatenated length in a crafted XPM file, which triggers a heap-based buffer overflow.
