### Description

Ubee EVW3226 cable modem/routers firmware versions up to and including 1.0.20 store configuration backup files in the web root after they are generated for download. These backup files remain accessible without authentication until the next reboot. A remote attacker on the local network can request 'Configuration_file.cfg' directly to obtain the backup archive. Because backup files are not encrypted, they expose sensitive information including the plaintext admin password, allowing full compromise of the device.
