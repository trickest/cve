### Description

The MOD_EXP_CTIME_COPY_FROM_PREBUF function in crypto/bn/bn_exp.c in OpenSSL 1.0.1 before 1.0.1s and 1.0.2 before 1.0.2g does not properly consider cache-bank access times during modular exponentiation, which makes it easier for local users to discover RSA keys by running a crafted application on the same Intel Sandy Bridge CPU core as a victim and leveraging cache-bank conflicts, aka a "CacheBleed" attack.
