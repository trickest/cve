### Description

MagniComp SysInfo before 10-H81, as shipped with BMC BladeLogic Automation and other products, contains an information exposure vulnerability in which a local unprivileged user is able to read any root (uid 0) owned file on the system, regardless of the file permissions. Confidential information such as password hashes (/etc/shadow) or other secrets (such as log files or private keys) can be leaked to the attacker. The vulnerability has a confidentiality impact, but has no direct impact on system integrity or availability.
