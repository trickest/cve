### Description

RunExeFile.exe in the installer for DEWESoft X3 SP1 (64-bit) devices does not require authentication for sessions on TCP port 1999, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or access internal commands, as demonstrated by a RUN command that launches a .EXE file located at an arbitrary external URL, or a "SETFIREWALL Off" command.
