### Description

ClipperCMS 1.3.3 does not have CSRF protection on its kcfinder file upload (enabled by default). This can be used by an attacker to perform actions for an admin (or any user with the file upload capability). With this vulnerability, one can automatically upload files (by default, it allows html, pdf, xml, zip, and many other file types). A file can be accessed publicly under the "/assets/files" directory.
