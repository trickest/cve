### Description

An issue was discovered in WildFly 10.1.2.Final. In the case of a default installation without a security realm reference, an attacker can successfully access the server without authentication. NOTE: the Security Realms documentation in the product's Admin Guide indicates that "without a security realm reference" implies "effectively unsecured." The vendor explicitly supports these unsecured configurations because they have valid use cases during development
