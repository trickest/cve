### Description

The websites that were built from Zeta Producer Desktop CMS before 14.2.1 are vulnerable to unauthenticated remote code execution due to a default component that permits arbitrary upload of PHP files, because the formmailer widget blocks .php files but not .php5 or .phtml files. This is related to /assets/php/formmailer/SendEmail.php and /assets/php/formmailer/functions.php.
