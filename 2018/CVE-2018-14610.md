### Description

An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 4.17.10. There is out-of-bounds access in write_extent_buffer() when mounting and operating a crafted btrfs image, because of a lack of verification that each block group has a corresponding chunk at mount time, within btrfs_read_block_groups in fs/btrfs/extent-tree.c.
