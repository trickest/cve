### Description

An issue was discovered in osquery. A maliciously crafted Universal/fat binary can evade third-party code signing checks. By not completing full inspection of the Universal/fat binary, the user of the third-party tool will believe that the code is signed by Apple, but the malicious unsigned code will execute. This issue affects osquery prior to v3.2.7
