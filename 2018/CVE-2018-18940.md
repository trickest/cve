### Description

servlet/SnoopServlet (a servlet installed by default) in Netscape Enterprise 3.63 has reflected XSS via an arbitrary parameter=[XSS] in the query string. A remote unauthenticated attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability to supply malicious HTML or JavaScript code to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser.  NOTE: this product is discontinued.
