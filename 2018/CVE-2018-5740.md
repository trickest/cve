### Description

"deny-answer-aliases" is a little-used feature intended to help recursive server operators protect end users against DNS rebinding attacks, a potential method of circumventing the security model used by client browsers. However, a defect in this feature makes it easy, when the feature is in use, to experience an assertion failure in name.c. Affects BIND 9.7.0->9.8.8, 9.9.0->9.9.13, 9.10.0->9.10.8, 9.11.0->9.11.4, 9.12.0->9.12.2, 9.13.0->9.13.2.
