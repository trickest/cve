### Description

** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in the Merlin.PHP component 0.6.6 for Asuswrt-Merlin devices. An attacker can execute arbitrary commands because exec.php has a popen call. NOTE: the vendor indicates that Merlin.PHP is designed only for use on a trusted intranet network, and intentionally allows remote code execution.
