### Description

In Lizard v1.0 and LZ5 v2.0 (the prior release, before the product was renamed), there is an unchecked buffer size during a memcpy in the Lizard_decompress_LIZv1 function (lib/lizard_decompress_liz.h). Remote attackers can leverage this vulnerability to cause a denial of service via a crafted input file, as well as achieve remote code execution.
