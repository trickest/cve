### Description

A sandbox escape issue was discovered in VyOS 1.1.8. It provides a restricted management shell for operator users to administer the device. By issuing various shell special characters with certain commands, an authenticated operator user can break out of the management shell and gain access to the underlying Linux shell. The user can then run arbitrary operating system commands with the privileges afforded by their account.
