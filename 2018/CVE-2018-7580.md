### Description

Philips Hue is vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack. Sending a SYN flood on port tcp/80 will freeze Philips Hue's hub and it will stop responding. The "hub" will stop operating and be frozen until the flood stops. During the flood, the user won't be able to turn on/off the lights, and all of the hub's functionality will be unresponsive. The cloud service also won't work with the hub.
