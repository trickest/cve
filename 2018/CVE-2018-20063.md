### Description

An issue was discovered in Gurock TestRail 5.6.0.3853. An "Unrestricted Upload of File" vulnerability exists in the image-upload form (available in the description editor), allowing remote authenticated users to execute arbitrary code by uploading an image file with an executable extension but a safe Content-Type value, and then accessing it via a direct request to the file in the file-upload directory (if it's accessible according to the server configuration).
