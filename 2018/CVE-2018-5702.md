### Description

Transmission through 2.92 relies on X-Transmission-Session-Id (which is not a forbidden header for Fetch) for access control, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary RPC commands, and consequently write to arbitrary files, via POST requests to /transmission/rpc in conjunction with a DNS rebinding attack.
