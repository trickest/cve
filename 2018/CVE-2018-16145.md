### Description

The /etc/init.d/opsview-reporting-module script that runs at boot time in Opsview Monitor before 5.3.1 and 5.4.x before 5.4.2 invokes a file that can be edited by the nagios user, and would allow attackers to elevate their privileges to root after a system restart, hence obtaining full control of the appliance.
