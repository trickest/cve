### Description

An issue was discovered in the Paymorrow module 1.0.0 before 1.0.2 and 2.0.0 before 2.0.1 for OXID eShop. An attacker can bypass delivery-address change detection if the payment module doesn't use eShop's checkout procedure properly. To do so, the attacker must change the delivery address to one that is not verified by the Paymorrow module.
