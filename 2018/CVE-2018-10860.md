### Description

perl-archive-zip is vulnerable to a directory traversal in Archive::Zip. It was found that the Archive::Zip module did not properly sanitize paths while extracting zip files. An attacker able to provide a specially crafted archive for processing could use this flaw to write or overwrite arbitrary files in the context of the perl interpreter.
