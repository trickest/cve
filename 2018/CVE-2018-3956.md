### Description

An exploitable out-of-bounds read vulnerability exists in the handling of certain XFA element attributes of Foxit Software's PDF Reader version 9.1.0.5096. A specially crafted PDF document can trigger an out-of-bounds read, which can disclose sensitive memory content and aid in exploitation when coupled with another vulnerability. An attacker needs to trick the user to open the malicious file to trigger this vulnerability. If the browser plugin extension is enabled, visiting a malicious site can also trigger the vulnerability.
