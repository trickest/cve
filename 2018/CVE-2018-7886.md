### Description

An issue was discovered in CloudMe 1.11.0. An unauthenticated local attacker that can connect to the "CloudMe Sync" client application listening on 127.0.0.1 port 8888 can send a malicious payload causing a buffer overflow condition. This will result in code execution, as demonstrated by a TCP reverse shell, or a crash. NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2018-6892.
