### Description

A vulnerability in MikroTik Version 6.41.4 could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to exhaust all available CPU and all available RAM by sending a crafted FTP request on port 21 that begins with many '\0' characters, preventing the affected router from accepting new FTP connections. The router will reboot after 10 minutes, logging a "router was rebooted without proper shutdown" message.
