### Description

The Sky Elite 6.0L+ Android device with a build fingerprint of SKY/x6069_trx_l601_sky/x6069_trx_l601_sky:6.0/MRA58K/1482897127:user/release-keys contains a pre-installed platform app with a package name of com.fw.upgrade.sysoper (versionCode=238, versionName=2.3.8) that contains an exported broadcast receiver app component named com.adups.fota.sysoper.WriteCommandReceiver that allows any app co-located on the device to supply arbitrary commands to be executed as the system user. The com.fw.upgrade.sysoper app cannot be disabled by the user and the attack can be performed by a zero-permission app. Executing commands as system user can allow a third-party app to video record the user's screen, factory reset the device, obtain the user's notifications, read the logcat logs, inject events in the Graphical User Interface (GUI), change the default Input Method Editor (IME) (e.g., keyboard) with one contained within the attacking app that contains keylogging functionality, obtain the user's text messages, and more.
