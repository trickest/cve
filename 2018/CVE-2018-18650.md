### Description

An issue was discovered in Xpdf 4.00. XRef::readXRefStream in XRef.cc allows attackers to launch a denial of service (Integer Overflow) via a crafted /Size value in a pdf file, as demonstrated by pdftohtml. This is mainly caused by the program attempting a malloc operation for a large amount of memory.
