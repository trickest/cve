### Description

An issue was discovered in Enalean Tuleap 9.17. Lack of CSRF attack mitigation while changing an e-mail address makes it possible to abuse the functionality by attackers. By making a CSRF attack, an attacker could make a victim change his registered e-mail address on the application, leading to account takeover.
