### Description

In the coff_pointerize_aux function in coffgen.c in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library (aka libbfd), as distributed in GNU Binutils 2.30, an index is not validated, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (segmentation fault) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted file, as demonstrated by objcopy of a COFF object.
