### Description

Failure to properly bounds-check a buffer used for processing DHCP options allows a malicious server (or an entity masquerading as a server) to cause a buffer overflow (and resulting crash) in dhclient by sending a response containing a specially constructed options section. Affects ISC DHCP versions 4.1.0 -> 4.1-ESV-R15, 4.2.0 -> 4.2.8, 4.3.0 -> 4.3.6, 4.4.0
