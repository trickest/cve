### Description

An exploitable vulnerability exists in the verified boot protection of the CUJO Smart Firewall. It is possible to add arbitrary shell commands into the dhcpd.conf file, that persist across reboots and firmware updates, and thus allow for executing unverified commands. To trigger this vulnerability, a local attacker needs to be able to write into /config/dhcpd.conf.
