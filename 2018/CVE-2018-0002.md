### Description

On SRX Series and MX Series devices with a Service PIC with any ALG enabled, a crafted TCP/IP response packet processed through the device results in memory corruption leading to a flowd daemon crash. Sustained crafted response packets lead to repeated crashes of the flowd daemon which results in an extended Denial of Service condition. Affected releases are Juniper Networks Junos OS: 12.1X46 versions prior to 12.1X46-D60 on SRX series; 12.3X48 versions prior to 12.3X48-D35 on SRX series; 14.1 versions prior to 14.1R9 on MX series; 14.2 versions prior to 14.2R8 on MX series; 15.1X49 versions prior to 15.1X49-D60 on SRX series; 15.1 versions prior to 15.1R5-S8, 15.1F6-S9, 15.1R6-S4, 15.1R7 on MX series; 16.1 versions prior to 16.1R6 on MX series; 16.2 versions prior to 16.2R3 on MX series; 17.1 versions prior to 17.1R2-S4, 17.1R3 on MX series.
