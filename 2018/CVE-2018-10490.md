### Description

This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Foxit Reader 9.0.0.29935. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of JPEG images embedded inside U3D files. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a memory access past the end of an allocated data structure. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code under the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-5422.
