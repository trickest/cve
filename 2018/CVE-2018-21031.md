### Description

Tautulli versions 2.1.38 and below allows remote attackers to bypass intended access control in Plex Media Server because the X-Plex-Token is mishandled and can be retrieved from Tautulli. NOTE: Initially, this id was associated with Plex Media Server 1.18.2.2029-36236cc4c as the affected product and version. Further research indicated that Tautulli is the correct affected product.
