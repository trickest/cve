### Description

An exploitable type confusion vulnerability exists in the way Foxit PDF Reader version 9.0.1.1049 parses files with associated file annotations. A specially crafted PDF document can lead to an object of invalid type to be dereferenced, which can potentially lead to sensitive memory disclosure, and possibly to arbitrary code execution. An attacker needs to trick the user into opening the malicious file to trigger this vulnerability. If the browser plugin extension is enabled, visiting a malicious site can also trigger the vulnerability.
