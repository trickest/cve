### Description

** DISPUTED ** In ncurses, possibly a 6.x version, there is a NULL pointer dereference at the function _nc_name_match that will lead to a denial of service attack. NOTE: the original report stated version 6.1, but the issue did not reproduce for that version according to the maintainer or a reliable third-party.
