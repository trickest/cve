### Description

** DISPUTED ** Liferay 6.2.x and before has an FCKeditor configuration that allows an attacker to upload or transfer files of dangerous types that can be automatically processed within the product's environment via a browser/liferay/browser.html?Type= or html/js/editor/fckeditor/editor/filemanager/browser/liferay/browser.html URI. NOTE: the vendor disputes this issue because file upload is an expected feature, subject to Role Based Access Control checks where only authenticated users with proper permissions can upload files.
