### Description

SSRF (Server Side Request Forgery) in /assets/lib/fuc.js.php in Cockpit 0.4.4 through 0.5.5 allows remote attackers to read arbitrary files or send TCP traffic to intranet hosts via the url parameter. NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2017-14611, which was about version 0.13.0, which (surprisingly) is an earlier version than 0.4.4.
