### Description

A vulnerability in the Pong tool of Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a reload of an affected device, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability exists because the affected software attempts to free the same area of memory twice. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a pong request to an affected device from a location on the network that causes the pong reply packet to egress both a FabricPath port and a non-FabricPath port. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a dual or quad supervisor virtual port-channel (vPC) to reload. This vulnerability affects the following products when running Cisco NX-OS Software Release 7.2(1)D(1), 7.2(2)D1(1), or 7.2(2)D1(2) with both the Pong and FabricPath features enabled and the FabricPath port is actively monitored via a SPAN session: Cisco Nexus 7000 Series Switches and Cisco Nexus 7700 Series Switches. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCuv98660.
