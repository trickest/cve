### Description

plays_service.exe in the plays.tv service before 1.27.7.0, as distributed in AMD driver-installation packages and Gaming Evolved products, contains an HTTP message parsing function that takes a user-defined path and writes non-user controlled data as SYSTEM to the file when the extract_files parameter is used. This occurs without properly authenticating the user.
