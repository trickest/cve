### Description

An issue was discovered on Moxa AWK-3121 1.19 devices. It provides functionality so that an administrator can change the name of the device. However, the same functionality allows an attacker to execute XSS by injecting an XSS payload. The POST parameter "iw_board_deviceName" is susceptible to this injection.
