### Description

RSA Authentication Manager versions prior to 8.3 P3 are affected by a DOM-based cross-site scripting vulnerability which exists in its embedded MadCap Flare Help files. A remote unauthenticated attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability by tricking a victim application user to supply malicious HTML or JavaScript code to the browser DOM, which code is then executed by the web browser in the context of the vulnerable web application.
