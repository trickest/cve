### Description

An issue was discovered on Samsung 840 EVO and 850 EVO devices (only in "ATA high" mode, not vulnerable in "TCG" or "ATA max" mode), Samsung T3 and T5 portable drives, and Crucial MX100, MX200 and MX300 devices. Absence of a cryptographic link between the password and the Disk Encryption Key allows attackers with privileged access to SSD firmware full access to encrypted data.
