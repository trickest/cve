### Description

Yubico libu2f-host 1.1.6 contains unchecked buffers in devs.c, which could enable a malicious token to exploit a buffer overflow. An attacker could use this to attempt to execute malicious code using a crafted USB device masquerading as a security token on a computer where the affected library is currently in use. It is not possible to perform this attack with a genuine YubiKey.
