### Description

RSA BSAFE Micro Edition Suite, prior to 4.1.6.1 (in 4.1.x), and RSA BSAFE Crypto-C Micro Edition versions prior to 4.0.5.3 (in 4.0.x) contain an Uncontrolled Resource Consumption ('Resource Exhaustion') vulnerability when parsing ASN.1 data. A remote attacker could use maliciously constructed ASN.1 data that would exhaust the stack, potentially causing a Denial Of Service.
