### Description

In GetSimpleCMS 3.3.15, admin/upload.php blocks .html uploads but there are several alternative cases in which HTML can be executed, such as a file with no extension or an unrecognized extension (e.g., the test or test.asdf filename), because of admin/upload-uploadify.php, and validate_safe_file in admin/inc/security_functions.php.
