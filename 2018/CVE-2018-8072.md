### Description

An issue was discovered on EDIMAX IC-3140W through 3.06, IC-5150W through 3.09, and IC-6220DC through 3.06 devices. The ipcam_cgi binary contains a stack-based buffer overflow that is possible to trigger from a remote unauthenticated /camera-cgi/public/getsysyeminfo.cgi?action=VALUE_HERE HTTP request: if the VALUE_HERE length is more than 0x400 (1024), it is possible to overwrite other values located on the stack due to an incorrect use of the strcpy() function.
