### Description

An issue was discovered in libtskfs.a in The Sleuth Kit (TSK) from release 4.0.2 through to 4.6.1. An out-of-bounds read of a memory region was found in the function ntfs_fix_idxrec in tsk/fs/ntfs_dent.cpp which could be leveraged by an attacker to disclose information or manipulated to read from unmapped memory causing a denial of service.
