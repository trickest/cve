### Description

TeamViewer through 13.1.1548 stores a password in Unicode format within TeamViewer.exe process memory between "[00 88] and "[00 00 00]" delimiters, which might make it easier for attackers to obtain sensitive information by leveraging an unattended workstation on which TeamViewer has disconnected but remains running.
