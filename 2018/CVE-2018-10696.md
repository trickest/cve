### Description

An issue was discovered on Moxa AWK-3121 1.14 devices. The device provides a web interface to allow an administrator to manage the device. However, this interface is not protected against CSRF attacks, which allows an attacker to trick an administrator into executing actions without his/her knowledge, as demonstrated by the forms/iw_webSetParameters and forms/webSetMainRestart URIs.
