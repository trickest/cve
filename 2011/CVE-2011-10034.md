### Description

AUTOMGEN versions up to and including 8.0.0.7 (also referenced as 8.022) contain a vulnerability in that project file handling frees an object and subsequently dereferences the stale pointer when processing certain malformed fields. The dangling-pointer use enables an attacker to influence an indirect call through attacker-controlled memory, resulting in denial-of-service. In some conditions, remote code execution may be possible.
