### Description

Parallels Plesk Small Business Panel 10.2.0 sends incorrect Content-Type headers for certain resources, which might allow remote attackers to have an unspecified impact by leveraging an interpretation conflict involving smb/app/top-categories-data/ and certain other files.  NOTE: it is possible that only clients, not the SmarterStats product, could be affected by this issue.
