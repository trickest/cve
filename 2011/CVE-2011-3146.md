### Description

librsvg before 2.34.1 uses the node name to identify the type of node, which allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a SVG file with a node with the element name starting with "fe," which is misidentified as a RsvgFilterPrimitive.
