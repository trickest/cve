### Description

upload_handler.php in the swfupload extension in Chyrp 2.0 and earlier relies on client-side JavaScript code to restrict the file extensions of uploaded files, which allows remote authenticated users to upload a .php file, and consequently execute arbitrary PHP code, via a write_post action to the default URI under admin/.
