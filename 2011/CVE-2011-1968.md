### Description

The Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) implementation in Microsoft Windows XP SP2 and SP3 and Windows Server 2003 SP2 does not properly process packets in memory, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (reboot) by sending crafted RDP packets triggering access to an object that (1) was not properly initialized or (2) is deleted, as exploited in the wild in 2011, aka "Remote Desktop Protocol Vulnerability."
