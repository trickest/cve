### Description

The Control Panel in Parallels Plesk Panel 10.2.0 build 20110407.20 sends incorrect Content-Type headers for certain resources, which might allow remote attackers to have an unspecified impact by leveraging an interpretation conflict involving smb/admin-home/featured-applications/ and certain other files.  NOTE: it is possible that only clients, not the Plesk product, could be affected by this issue.
