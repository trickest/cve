### Description

crypto/bn/bn_nist.c in OpenSSL before 0.9.8h on 32-bit platforms, as used in stunnel and other products, in certain circumstances involving ECDH or ECDHE cipher suites, uses an incorrect modular reduction algorithm in its implementation of the P-256 and P-384 NIST elliptic curves, which allows remote attackers to obtain the private key of a TLS server via multiple handshake attempts.
