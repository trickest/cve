### Description

Parallels Plesk Small Business Panel 10.2.0 does not properly validate string data that is intended for storage in an XML document, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (parsing error) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted cookie, as demonstrated by cookies to client@1/domain@1/hosting/file-manager/ and certain other files.
