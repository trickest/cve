### Description

Parallels Plesk Small Business Panel 10.2.0 omits the Content-Type header's charset parameter for certain resources, which might allow remote attackers to have an unspecified impact by leveraging an interpretation conflict involving domains/sitebuilder_edit.php and certain other files.  NOTE: it is possible that only clients, not the SmarterStats product, could be affected by this issue.
