### Description

SmarterTools SmarterStats 6.2.4100 sends incorrect Content-Type headers for certain resources, which might allow remote attackers to have an unspecified impact by leveraging an interpretation conflict involving frmCustomReport.aspx and certain other files.  NOTE: it is possible that only clients, not the SmarterStats product, could be affected by this issue.
