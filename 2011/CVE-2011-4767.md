### Description

The Site Editor (aka SiteBuilder) feature in Parallels Plesk Small Business Panel 10.2.0 has web pages containing e-mail addresses that are not intended for correspondence about the local application deployment, which allows remote attackers to obtain potentially sensitive information by reading a page, as demonstrated by js/Wizard/Status.js and certain other files.
