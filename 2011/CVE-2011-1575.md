### Description

The STARTTLS implementation in ftp_parser.c in Pure-FTPd before 1.0.30 does not properly restrict I/O buffering, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to insert commands into encrypted FTP sessions by sending a cleartext command that is processed after TLS is in place, related to a "plaintext command injection" attack, a similar issue to CVE-2011-0411.
