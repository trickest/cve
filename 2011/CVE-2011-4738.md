### Description

The Control Panel in Parallels Plesk Panel 10.2.0 build 20110407.20 does not include the HTTPOnly flag in a Set-Cookie header for a cookie, which makes it easier for remote attackers to obtain potentially sensitive information via script access to this cookie, as demonstrated by cookies used by get_password.php and certain other files.
