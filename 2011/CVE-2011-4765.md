### Description

The Site Editor (aka SiteBuilder) feature in Parallels Plesk Small Business Panel 10.2.0 does not include the HTTPOnly flag in a Set-Cookie header for a cookie, which makes it easier for remote attackers to obtain potentially sensitive information via script access to this cookie, as demonstrated by cookies used by Wizard/Edit/Modules/ImageGallery/MultiImagesUpload and certain other files.
