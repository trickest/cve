### Description

Multiple integer overflows in xpdf 2.0 and 3.0, and other packages that use xpdf code such as CUPS, gpdf, and kdegraphics, allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code, a different set of vulnerabilities than those identified by CVE-2004-0889.
