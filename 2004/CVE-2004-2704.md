### Description

Hastymail 1.0.1 and earlier (stable) and 1.1 and earlier (development) does not send the "attachment" parameter in the Content-Disposition field for attachments, which causes the attachment to be rendered inline by Internet Explorer when the victim clicks the download link, which facilitates cross-site scripting (XSS) and possibly other attacks.
