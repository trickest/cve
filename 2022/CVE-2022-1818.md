### Description

The Multi-page Toolkit WordPress plugin through 2.6 does not have CSRF check in place when updating its settings, which could allow attackers to make a logged in admin change them via a CSRF attack and lead to Stored Cross-Site Scripting due to the lack of sanitisation and escaping as well
