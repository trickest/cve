### Description

A vulnerability was found in X.Org. This security flaw occurs because the XkbCopyNames function left a dangling pointer to freed memory, resulting in out-of-bounds memory access on subsequent XkbGetKbdByName requests.. This issue can lead to local privileges elevation on systems where the X server is running privileged and remote code execution for ssh X forwarding sessions.
