### Description

Archer 6.x through 6.10 (6.10.0.0) contains a reflected XSS vulnerability. A remote SAML-unauthenticated malicious Archer user could potentially exploit this vulnerability by tricking a victim application user into supplying malicious HTML or JavaScript code to the vulnerable web application; the malicious code is then reflected back to the victim and gets executed by the web browser in the context of the vulnerable web application.
