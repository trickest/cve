### Description

A flawed pseudorandom number generator in Dominion Voting Systems ImageCast Precinct (ICP and ICP2) and ImageCast Evolution (ICE) scanners allows anyone to determine the order in which ballots were cast from public ballot-level data, allowing deanonymization of voted ballots, in several types of scenarios. This issue was observed for use of the following versions of Democracy Suite: 5.2, 5.4-NM, 5.5, 5.5-A, 5.5-B, 5.5-C, 5.5-D, 5.7-A, 5.10, 5.10A, 5.15. NOTE: the Democracy Suite 5.17 EAC Certificate of Conformance mentions "Improved pseudo random number algorithm," which may be relevant.
