### Description

Jenkins Semantic Versioning Plugin 1.13 and earlier does not restrict execution of an controller/agent message to agents, and implements no limitations about the file path that can be parsed, allowing attackers able to control agent processes to have Jenkins parse a crafted file that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins controller or server-side request forgery.
