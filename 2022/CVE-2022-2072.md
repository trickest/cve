### Description

The Name Directory WordPress plugin before 1.25.3 does not sanitise and escape a parameter before outputting it back in the page, leading to a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting. Furthermore, as the payload is also saved into the database after the request, it leads to a Stored XSS as well
