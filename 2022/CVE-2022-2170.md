### Description

The Microsoft Advertising Universal Event Tracking (UET) WordPress plugin before 1.0.4 does not sanitise and escape its settings, allowing high privilege users such as admin to perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered_html capability is disallowed. Due to the nature of this plugin, well crafted XSS can also leak into the frontpage.
