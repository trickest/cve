### Description

DBLTek GoIP-1 firmware versions up to and including GHSFVT-1.1-67-5 contain a local file inclusion vulnerability. The device's web server exposes handlers (`frame.html` and `frame.A100.html`) that accept a path parameter (`content` or `sidebar`) which is not properly validated or canonicalized. An attacker can supply directory-traversal sequences to cause the server to read and return arbitrary filesystem files that the webserver user can access. Other GoIP models and firmware versions are likely affected. Exploitation evidence was observed by the Shadowserver Foundation on 2024-03-21 UTC.
