### Description

An issue was discovered in Simmeth Lieferantenmanager before 5.6. Due to errors in session management, an attacker can log back into a victim's account after the victim logged out - /LMS/LM/#main can be used for this. This is due to the credentials not being cleaned from the local storage after logout.
