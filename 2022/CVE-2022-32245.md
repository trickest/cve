### Description

SAP BusinessObjects Business Intelligence Platform (Open Document) - versions 420, 430, allows an unauthenticated attacker to retrieve sensitive information plain text over the network.

Thus, completely compromising confidentiality but causing a limited impact on the availability of the application.
