### Description

NVIDIA GPU Display Driver for Windows contains a vulnerability in the DirectX11 user mode driver (nvwgf2um/x.dll), where an unauthorized attacker on the network can cause an out-of-bounds write through a specially crafted shader, which may lead to code execution to cause denial of service, escalation of privileges, information disclosure, and data tampering. The scope of the impact may extend to other components.
