### Description

In affected versions of Octopus Server the help sidebar can be customized to include a Cross-Site Scripting payload in the support link. This was initially resolved in advisory 2022-07 however it was identified that the fix could be bypassed in certain circumstances. A different approach was taken to prevent the possibility of the support link being susceptible to XSS
