### Description

In Airspan AirSpot 5410 version 0.3.4.1-4 and under there exists a stored XSS vulnerability. As the binary file /home/www/cgi-bin/login.cgi does not check if the user is authenticated, a malicious actor can craft a specific request on the login.cgi endpoint that contains a base32 encoded XSS payload that will be accepted and stored. A successful attack will results in the injection of malicious scripts into the user settings page.
