### Description

The WP Custom Cursors WordPress plugin before 3.0.1 does not have CSRF check in place when creating and editing cursors, which could allow attackers to made a logged in admin perform such actions via CSRF attacks. Furthermore, due to the lack of sanitisation and escaping in some of the cursor options, it could also lead to Stored Cross-Site Scripting
