### Description

An issue was discovered on certain Nuki Home Solutions devices. The HTTP API exposed by a Bridge used an unencrypted channel to provide an administrative interface. A token can be easily eavesdropped by a malicious actor to impersonate a legitimate user and gain access to the full set of API endpoints. This affects Nuki Bridge v1 before 1.22.0 and v2 before 2.13.2.
