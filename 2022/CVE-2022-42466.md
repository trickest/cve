### Description

Prior to 2.0.0-M9, it was possible for an end-user to set the value of an editable string property of a domain object to a value that would be rendered unchanged when the value was saved. In particular, the end-user could enter javascript or similar and this would be executed. As of this release, the inputted strings are properly escaped when rendered.
