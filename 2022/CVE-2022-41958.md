### Description

super-xray is a web vulnerability scanning tool. Versions prior to 0.7 assumed trusted input for the program config which is stored in a yaml file. An attacker with local access to the file could exploit this and compromise the program. This issue has been addressed in commit `4d0d5966` and will be included in future releases. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.
