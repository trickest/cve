### Description

** DISPUTED ** The py library through 1.11.0 for Python allows remote attackers to conduct a ReDoS (Regular expression Denial of Service) attack via a Subversion repository with crafted info data, because the InfoSvnCommand argument is mishandled. Note: This has been disputed by multiple third parties as not being reproduceable and they argue this is not a valid vulnerability.
