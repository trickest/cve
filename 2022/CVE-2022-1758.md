### Description

The Genki Pre-Publish Reminder WordPress plugin through 1.4.1 does not have CSRF check in place when updating its settings, which could allow attackers to make a logged in admin change them via a CSRF attack and lead to Stored XSS as well as RCE when custom code is added via the plugin settings.
