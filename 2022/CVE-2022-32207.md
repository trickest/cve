### Description

When curl < 7.84.0 saves cookies, alt-svc and hsts data to local files, it makes the operation atomic by finalizing the operation with a rename from a temporary name to the final target file name.In that rename operation, it might accidentally *widen* the permissions for the target file, leaving the updated file accessible to more users than intended.
