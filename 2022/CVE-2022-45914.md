### Description

The ESL (Electronic Shelf Label) protocol, as implemented by (for example) the OV80e934802 RF transceiver on the ETAG-2130-V4.3 20190629 board, does not use authentication, which allows attackers to change label values via 433 MHz RF signals, as demonstrated by disrupting the organization of a hospital storage unit, or changing retail pricing.
