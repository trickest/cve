### Description

The TP-240 (aka tp240dvr) component in Mitel MiCollab before 9.4 SP1 FP1 and MiVoice Business Express through 8.1 allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information and cause a denial of service (performance degradation and excessive outbound traffic). This was exploited in the wild in February and March 2022 for the TP240PhoneHome DDoS attack.
