### Description

An issue was discovered in Connected Vehicle Systems Alliance (COVESA) dlt-daemon through 2.18.8. Due to a faulty DLT file parser, a crafted DLT file that crashes the process can be created. This is due to missing validation checks. There is a heap-based buffer over-read of one byte.
