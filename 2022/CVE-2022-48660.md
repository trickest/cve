### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:gpiolib: cdev: Set lineevent_state::irq after IRQ register successfullyWhen running gpio test on nxp-ls1028 platform with below commandgpiomon --num-events=3 --rising-edge gpiochip1 25There will be a warning trace as below:Call trace:free_irq+0x204/0x360lineevent_free+0x64/0x70gpio_ioctl+0x598/0x6a0__arm64_sys_ioctl+0xb4/0x100invoke_syscall+0x5c/0x130......el0t_64_sync+0x1a0/0x1a4The reason of this issue is that calling request_threaded_irq()function failed, and then lineevent_free() is invoked to releasethe resource. Since the lineevent_state::irq was already set, sothe subsequent invocation of free_irq() would trigger the abovewarning call trace. To fix this issue, set the lineevent_state::irqafter the IRQ register successfully.
