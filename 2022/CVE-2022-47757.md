### Description

In imo.im 2022.11.1051, a path traversal vulnerability delivered via an unsanitized deeplink can force the application to write a file into the application's data directory. This may allow an attacker to save a shared library under a special directory which the app uses to dynamically load modules. Loading the library can lead to arbitrary code execution.
