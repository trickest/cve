### Description

Poppler prior to and including 22.08.0 contains an integer overflow in the JBIG2 decoder (JBIG2Stream::readTextRegionSeg() in JBIGStream.cc). Processing a specially crafted PDF file or JBIG2 image could lead to a crash or the execution of arbitrary code. This is similar to the vulnerability described by CVE-2022-38171 in Xpdf.
