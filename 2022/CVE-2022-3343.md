### Description

The WPQA Builder WordPress plugin before 5.9.3 (which is a companion plugin used with Discy and Himer Discy WordPress themes) incorrectly tries to validate that a user already follows another in the wpqa_following_you_ajax action, allowing a user to inflate their score on the site by having another user send repeated follow actions to them.
