### Description

The Slide Anything WordPress plugin before 2.3.47 does not properly sanitize or escape the slide title before outputting it in the admin pages, allowing a logged in user with roles as low as Author to inject a javascript payload into the slide title even when the unfiltered_html capability is disabled.
