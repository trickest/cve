### Description

TeamViewer Linux versions before 15.28 do not properly execute a deletion command for the connection password in case of a process crash. Knowledge of the crash event and the TeamViewer ID as well as either possession of the pre-crash connection password or local authenticated access to the machine would have allowed to establish a remote connection by reusing the not properly deleted connection password.
