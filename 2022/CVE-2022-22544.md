### Description

Solution Manager (Diagnostics Root Cause Analysis Tools) - version 720, allows an administrator to execute code on all connected Diagnostics Agents and browse files on their systems. An attacker could thereby control the managed systems. It is considered that this is a missing segregation of duty for the SAP Solution Manager administrator. Impacts of unauthorized execution of commands can lead to sensitive information disclosure, loss of system integrity and denial of service.
