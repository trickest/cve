### Description

Protections against potential Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerabilities in Esri Portal for ArcGIS versions 10.9.1 and below were not fully honored and may allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to forge requests to arbitrary URLs from the system, potentially leading to network enumeration or reading from hosts inside the network perimeter, a different issue than CVE-2022-38211 and CVE-2022-38212.
