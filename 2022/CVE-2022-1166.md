### Description

The JobMonster Theme was vulnerable to Directory Listing in the /wp-content/uploads/jobmonster/ folder, as it did not include a default PHP file, or .htaccess file. This could expose personal data such as people's resumes. Although Directory Listing can be prevented by securely configuring the web server, vendors can also take measures to make it less likely to happen.
