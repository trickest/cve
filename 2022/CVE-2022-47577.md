### Description

An issue was discovered in the endpoint protection agent in Zoho ManageEngine Device Control Plus 10.1.2228.15. Despite configuring complete restrictions on USB pendrives, USB HDD devices, memory cards, USB connections to mobile devices, etc., it is still possible to bypass the USB restrictions by making use of a virtual machine (VM). This allows a file to be exchanged outside the laptop/system. VMs can be created by any user (even without admin rights). The data exfiltration can occur without any record in the audit trail of Windows events on the host machine. NOTE: the vendor's position is "it's not a vulnerability in our product."
