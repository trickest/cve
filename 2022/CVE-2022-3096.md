### Description

The WP Total Hacks WordPress plugin through 4.7.2 does not prevent low privilege users from modifying the plugin's settings. This could allow users such as subscribers to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks against other users, like administrators, due to the lack of sanitisation and escaping as well.
