### Description

Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal') vulnerability was discovered via an HTTP API on Western Digital My Cloud Home; My Cloud Home Duo; and SanDisk ibi devices that could allow an attacker to abuse certain parameters to point to random locations on the file system. This could also allow the attacker to initiate the installation of custom packages at these locations. This can only be exploited once the attacker has been authenticated to the device. This issue affects: Western Digital My Cloud Home and My Cloud Home Duo versions prior to 8.11.0-113 on Linux; SanDisk ibi versions prior to 8.11.0-113 on Linux.
