### Description

The Ultimate Member plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution in versions up to, and including, 2.5.0 via the get_option_value_from_callback function that accepts user supplied input and passes it through call_user_func(). This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrative capabilities, to execute code on the server.
