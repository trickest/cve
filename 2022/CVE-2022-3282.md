### Description

The Drag and Drop Multiple File Upload WordPress plugin before 1.3.6.5 does not properly check for the upload size limit set in forms, taking the value from user input sent when submitting the form. As a result, attackers could control the file length limit and bypass the limit set by admins in the contact form.
