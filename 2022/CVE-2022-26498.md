### Description

An issue was discovered in Asterisk through 19.x. When using STIR/SHAKEN, it is possible to download files that are not certificates. These files could be much larger than what one would expect to download, leading to Resource Exhaustion. This is fixed in 16.25.2, 18.11.2, and 19.3.2.
