### Description

An out-of-bounds read vulnerability was discovered in the PCRE2 library in the compile_xclass_matchingpath() function of the pcre2_jit_compile.c file. This involves a unicode property matching issue in JIT-compiled regular expressions. The issue occurs because the character was not fully read in case-less matching within JIT.
