### Description

Eval injection vulnerability in index.php in ClanSys 1.1 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via PHP code in the page parameter, as demonstrated by using an "include" statement that is injected into the eval statement.  NOTE: this issue has been described as file inclusion by some sources, but that is just one attack; the primary vulnerability is eval injection.
