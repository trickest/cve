### Description

SQL injection vulnerability in articles.asp in Expinion.net iNews (1) Publisher (iNP) 2.5 and earlier, and possibly (2) News Manager, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the ex parameter.  NOTE: early reports of this issue reported it as XSS, but this was erroneous.  The original report was for News Manager, but there is strong evidence that the correct product is Publisher.
