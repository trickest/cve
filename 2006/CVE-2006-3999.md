### Description

ISS BlackICE PC Protection 3.6.cpj, 3.6.cpiE, and possibly earlier versions do not properly monitor the integrity of the pamversion.dll BlackICE library, which allows local users to subvert BlackICE by replacing pamversion.dll.  NOTE: in most cases, the attack would not cross privilege boundaries because replacing pamversion.dll requires administrative privileges. However, this issue is a vulnerability because BlackICE is intended to protect against certain rogue privileged actions.
