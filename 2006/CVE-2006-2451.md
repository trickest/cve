### Description

The suid_dumpable support in Linux kernel 2.6.13 up to versions before 2.6.17.4, and 2.6.16 before 2.6.16.24, allows a local user to cause a denial of service (disk consumption) and possibly gain privileges via the PR_SET_DUMPABLE argument of the prctl function and a program that causes a core dump file to be created in a directory for which the user does not have permissions.
