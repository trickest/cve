### Description

Buffer overflow in certain Asian language versions of Microsoft Excel might allow user-assisted attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted STYLE record in a spreadsheet that triggers the overflow when the user attempts to repair the document or selects the "Style" option, as demonstrated by nanika.xls.  NOTE: Microsoft has confirmed to CVE via e-mail that this is different than the other Excel vulnerabilities announced before 20060707, including CVE-2006-3059 and CVE-2006-3086.
