### Description

Directory traversal vulnerability in language.php in phpAlbum 0.4.1 Beta 6 and earlier, when magic_quotes_gpc is disabled and register_globals is enabled, allows remote attackers to include and execute arbitrary local files or obtain sensitive information via a .. (dot dot) in the pa_lang[include_file] parameter, as demonstrated by injecting PHP sequences into an Apache HTTP Server log file, which is then included by language.php.
