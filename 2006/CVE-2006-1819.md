### Description

Directory traversal vulnerability in the loadConfig function in index.php in phpWebSite 0.10.2 and earlier allows remote attackers to include arbitrary local files and execute arbitrary PHP code via the hub_dir parameter, as demonstrated by including access_log.  NOTE: in some cases, arbitrary remote file inclusion could be performed under PHP 5 using an SMB share argument such as "\\systemname\sharename".
