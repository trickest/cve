### Description

The default configuration of Fluffington FLog 1.01 installs users.0.dat under the web document root with insufficient access control, which might allow remote attackers to obtain sensitive information (login credentials) via a direct request.  NOTE: It was later reported that 1.1.2 is also affected.
