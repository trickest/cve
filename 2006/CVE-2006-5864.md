### Description

Stack-based buffer overflow in the ps_gettext function in ps.c for GNU gv 3.6.2, and possibly earlier versions, allows user-assisted attackers to execute arbitrary code via a PostScript (PS) file with certain headers that contain long comments, as demonstrated using the (1) DocumentMedia, (2) DocumentPaperSizes, and possibly (3) PageMedia and (4) PaperSize headers.  NOTE: this issue can be exploited through other products that use gv such as evince.
