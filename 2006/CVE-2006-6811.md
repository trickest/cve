### Description

KsIRC 1.3.12 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via a long PRIVMSG string when connecting to an Internet Relay Chat (IRC) server, which causes an assertion failure and results in a NULL pointer dereference.  NOTE: this issue was originally reported as a buffer overflow.
