### Description

RealVNC 4.1.1, and other products that use RealVNC such as AdderLink IP and Cisco CallManager, allows remote attackers to bypass authentication via a request in which the client specifies an insecure security type such as "Type 1 - None", which is accepted even if it is not offered by the server, as originally demonstrated using a long password.
