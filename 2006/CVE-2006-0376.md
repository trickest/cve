### Description

The 802.11 wireless client in certain operating systems including Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003 does not warn the user when (1) it establishes an association with a station in ad hoc (aka peer-to-peer) mode or (2) a station in ad hoc mode establishes an association with it, which allows remote attackers to put unexpected wireless communication into place.
