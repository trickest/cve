### Description

Multiple directory traversal vulnerabilities in Open Solution Quick.Cart 2.0, when register_globals is enabled and magic_quotes_gpc is disabled, allow remote attackers to include and execute arbitrary local files via a .. (dot dot) in the config[db_type] parameter to (1) categories.php, (2) couriers.php, (3) orders.php, and (4) products.php in actions_admin/; and (5) orders.php and (6) products.php in actions_client/; as demonstrated by injecting PHP sequences into an Apache HTTP Server log file, which is then included by one of these PHP scripts.
