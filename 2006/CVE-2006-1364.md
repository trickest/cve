### Description

Microsoft w3wp (aka w3wp.exe) does not properly handle when the AspCompat directive is not used when referencing COM components in ASP.NET, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (resource consumption or crash) by repeatedly requesting each of several documents that refer to COM components, or are restricted documents located under the ASP.NET application path.
