### Description

The sys_timer_create function in posix-timers.c for Linux kernel 2.6.x allows local users to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) and possibly bypass memory limits or cause other processes to be killed by creating a large number of posix timers, which are allocated in kernel memory but are not treated as part of the process' memory.
