### Description

Multiple PHP remote file inclusion vulnerabilities in ExBB 1.9.1, when register_globals is enabled, allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the exbb[home_path] parameter in files in the modules directory including (1) birstday/birst.php (2) birstday/select.php, (3) birstday/profile_show.php, (4) newusergreatings/pm_newreg.php, (5) punish/p_error.php, (6) punish/profile.php, and (7) threadstop/threadstop.php.  NOTE: the (8) modules/userstop/userstop.php vector might overlap CVE-2006-4488, although it is for a slightly different product from the same vendor.
