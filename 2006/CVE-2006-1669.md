### Description

SQL injection vulnerability in chat/messagesL.php3 in phpHeaven Team PHPMyChat 0.14.5 and earlier allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the T parameter.  NOTE: this issue can be leveraged to execute arbitrary shell commands since the username is later processed in an eval() call, but since the username originated from the SQL injection, it could be a resultant issue.
