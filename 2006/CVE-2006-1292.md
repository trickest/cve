### Description

Directory traversal vulnerability in Jim Hu and Chad Little PHP iCalendar 2.21 and earlier allows remote attackers to include and execute arbitrary local files via directory traversal sequences and a NUL (%00) character in the phpicalendar[cookie_language] and phpicalendar[cookie_style] cookies, as demonstrated by injecting PHP sequences into an Apache access_log file, which is then included by day.php.
