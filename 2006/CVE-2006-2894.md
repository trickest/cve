### Description

Mozilla Firefox 1.5.0.4, 2.0.x before 2.0.0.8, Mozilla Suite 1.7.13, Mozilla SeaMonkey 1.0.2 and other versions before 1.1.5, and Netscape 8.1 and earlier allow user-assisted remote attackers to read arbitrary files by tricking a user into typing the characters of the target filename in a text box and using the OnKeyDown, OnKeyPress, and OnKeyUp Javascript keystroke events to change the focus and cause those characters to be inserted into a file upload input control, which can then upload the file when the user submits the form.
