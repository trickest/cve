### Description

Concurrency vulnerability in Mozilla Firefox 1.5.0.6 and earlier allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via multiple Javascript timed events that load a deeply nested XML file, followed by redirecting the browser to another page, which leads to a concurrency failure that causes structures to be freed incorrectly, as demonstrated by (1) ffoxdie and (2) ffoxdie3.  NOTE: it has been reported that Netscape 8.1 and K-Meleon 1.0.1 are also affected by ffoxdie.  Mozilla confirmed to CVE that ffoxdie and ffoxdie3 trigger the same underlying vulnerability.  NOTE: it was later reported that Firefox 2.0 RC2 and 1.5.0.7 are also affected.
