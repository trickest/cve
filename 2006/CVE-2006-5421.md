### Description

WSN Forum 1.3.4 and earlier allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a modified pathname in the pathtoconfig parameter that points to an avatar image that contains PHP code, which is then accessed from prestart.php.  NOTE: this issue has been labeled remote file inclusion, but that label only applies to the attack, not the underlying vulnerability.
