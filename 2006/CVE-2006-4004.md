### Description

Directory traversal vulnerability in index.php in vbPortal 3.0.2 through 3.6.0 Beta 1, when magic_quotes_gpc is disabled, allows remote attackers to include and execute arbitrary local files via directory traversal sequences in the bbvbplang cookie, as demonstrated by injecting PHP sequences into an Apache HTTP Server log file, which is then included by index.php.
