### Description

astrocam.cgi in AstroCam 0.9-1-1 through 1.4.0 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via shell metacharacters in an HTTP request.  NOTE: earlier disclosures stated that the affected versions were 1.7.1 through 2.1.2, but the vendor explicitly stated that these were incorrect.
