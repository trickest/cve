### Description

Multiple SSH2 servers and clients do not properly handle strings with null characters in them when the string length is specified by a length field, which could allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code due to interactions with the use of null-terminated strings as implemented using languages such as C, as demonstrated by the SSHredder SSH protocol test suite.
