### Description

Mozilla Firefox before 38.0 on Android does not properly restrict writing URL data to the Android logging system, which allows attackers to obtain sensitive information via a crafted application that has a required permission for reading a log, as demonstrated by the READ_LOGS permission for the mixed-content violation log on Android 4.0 and earlier.
