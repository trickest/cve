### Description

Exponent CMS before 2.3.7 does not properly restrict the types of files that can be uploaded, which allows remote attackers to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks and possibly have other unspecified impact as demonstrated by uploading a file with an .html extension, then accessing it via the elFinder functionality.
