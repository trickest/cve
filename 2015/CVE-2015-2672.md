### Description

The xsave/xrstor implementation in arch/x86/include/asm/xsave.h in the Linux kernel before 3.19.2 creates certain .altinstr_replacement pointers and consequently does not provide any protection against instruction faulting, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (panic) by triggering a fault, as demonstrated by an unaligned memory operand or a non-canonical address memory operand.
