### Description

In Redgate SQL Monitor before 3.10 and 4.x before 4.2, a remote attacker can gain unauthenticated access to the Base Monitor, resulting in the ability to execute arbitrary SQL commands on any monitored Microsoft SQL Server machines. If the Base Monitor is connecting to these machines using an account with SQL admin privileges, then code execution on the operating system can result in full system compromise (if Microsoft SQL Server is running with local administrator privileges).
