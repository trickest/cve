### Description

SQLite before 3.8.9 does not properly implement the dequoting of collation-sequence names, which allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (uninitialized memory access and application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted COLLATE clause, as demonstrated by COLLATE"""""""" at the end of a SELECT statement.
