### Description

name.c in named in ISC BIND 9.7.x through 9.9.x before 9.9.7-P1 and 9.10.x before 9.10.2-P2, when configured as a recursive resolver with DNSSEC validation, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (REQUIRE assertion failure and daemon exit) by constructing crafted zone data and then making a query for a name in that zone.
