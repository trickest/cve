### Description

Basware Banking (Maksuliikenne) before 9.10.0.0 does not encrypt communication between the client and the backend server, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to obtain encryption keys, user credentials, and other sensitive information by sniffing the network or modify this traffic by inserting packets into the client-server data stream.
