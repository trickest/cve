### Description

PCRE before 8.38 mishandles the /(?|(\k'Pm')|(?'Pm'))/ pattern and related patterns with certain forward references, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (buffer overflow) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted regular expression, as demonstrated by a JavaScript RegExp object encountered by Konqueror.
