### Description

The tweet_info function in class/__functions.php in the SecureMoz Security Audit plugin 1.0.5 and earlier for WordPress does not use an HTTPS session for downloading serialized data, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to conduct PHP object injection attacks and execute arbitrary PHP code by modifying the client-server data stream.  NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third party information.
