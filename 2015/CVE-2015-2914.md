### Description

Securifi Almond devices with firmware before AL1-R201EXP10-L304-W34 and Almond-2015 devices with firmware before AL2-R088M use a fixed source-port number in outbound DNS queries performed on behalf of any device, which makes it easier for remote attackers to spoof responses by using this number for the destination port, a different vulnerability than CVE-2015-7296.
