### Description

An issue was discovered on Samsung mobile devices with JBP(4.3) and KK(4.4.2) software. Because the READ_LOGS permission is mishandled, sensitive information is disclosed in a world-readable copy of the log file if the error message is "Unhandled exception in Dalvik VM," "Application not responding ANR event," or "Crash on an application's native code." The Samsung ID is SVE-2015-2885 (October 2015).
