### Description

The host memory mapping path feature in the NVIDIA GPU graphics driver R346 before 346.87 and R352 before 352.41 for Linux and R352 before 352.46 for GRID vGPU and vSGA does not properly restrict access to third-party device IO memory, which allows attackers to gain privileges, cause a denial of service (resource consumption), or possibly have unspecified other impact via unknown vectors related to the follow_pfn kernel-mode API call.
