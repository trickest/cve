### Description

An issue was discovered on Mitsubishi Electric Europe B.V. ME-RTU devices through 2.02 and INEA ME-RTU devices through 3.0. Hard-coded SSH keys allow an attacker to gain unauthorised access or disclose encrypted data on the RTU due to the keys not being regenerated on initial installation or with firmware updates. In other words, these devices use private-key values in /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key, /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key, and /etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key files that are publicly available from the vendor web sites.
