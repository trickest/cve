### Description

An issue was discovered in a smart contract implementation for AIRDROPX BORN through 2019-05-29, an Ethereum token. The name of the constructor has a typo (wrong case: XBornID versus XBORNID) that allows an attacker to change the owner of the contract and obtain cryptocurrency for free.
