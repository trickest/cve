### Description

In FreeBSD 12.0-STABLE before r350246, 12.0-RELEASE before 12.0-RELEASE-p8, 11.3-STABLE before r350247, 11.3-RELEASE before 11.3-RELEASE-p1, and 11.2-RELEASE before 11.2-RELEASE-p12, the emulated XHCI device included with the bhyve hypervisor did not properly validate data provided by the guest, allowing an out-of-bounds read. This provides a malicious guest the possibility to crash the system or access system memory.
