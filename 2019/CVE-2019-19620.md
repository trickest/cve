### Description

In SecureWorks Red Cloak Windows Agent before 2.0.7.9, a local user can bypass the generation of telemetry alerts by removing NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM permissions from a file. This is limited in scope to the collection of process-execution telemetry, for executions against specific files where the SYSTEM user was denied access to the source file.
