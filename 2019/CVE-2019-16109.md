### Description

An issue was discovered in Plataformatec Devise before 4.7.1. It confirms accounts upon receiving a request with a blank confirmation_token, if a database record has a blank value in the confirmation_token column. (However, there is no scenario within Devise itself in which such database records would exist.)
