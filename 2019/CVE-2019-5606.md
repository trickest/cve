### Description

In FreeBSD 12.0-STABLE before r349805, 12.0-RELEASE before 12.0-RELEASE-p8, 11.3-STABLE before r349806, 11.3-RELEASE before 11.3-RELEASE-p1, and 11.2-RELEASE before 11.2-RELEASE-p12, code which handles close of a descriptor created by posix_openpt fails to undo a signal configuration. This causes an incorrect signal to be raised leading to a write after free of kernel memory allowing a malicious user to gain root privileges or escape a jail.
