### Description

An issue was discovered in Selesta Visual Access Manager (VAM) 4.15.0 through 4.29. An attacker without authentication is able to execute arbitrary SQL SELECT statements by injecting the HTTP (POST or GET) parameter persoid into /tools/VamPersonPhoto.php. The SQL Injection type is Error-based (this means that relies on error messages thrown by the database server to obtain information about the structure of the database).
