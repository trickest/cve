### Description

An issue was discovered in Serpico (aka SimplE RePort wrIting and CollaboratiOn tool) 1.3.0. It does not use CSRF Tokens to mitigate against CSRF; it uses the Origin header (which must match the request origin). This is problematic in conjunction with XSS: one can escalate privileges from User level to Administrator.
