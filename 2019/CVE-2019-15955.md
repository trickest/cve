### Description

An issue was discovered in Total.js CMS 12.0.0. A low privilege user can perform a simple transformation of a cookie to obtain the random values inside it. If an attacker can discover a session cookie owned by an admin, then it is possible to brute force it with O(n)=2n instead of O(n)=n^x complexity, and steal the admin password.
