### Description

A flaw was found in Hibernate ORM in versions before 5.3.18, 5.4.18 and 5.5.0.Beta1. A SQL injection in the implementation of the JPA Criteria API can permit unsanitized literals when a literal is used in the SELECT or GROUP BY parts of the query. This flaw could allow an attacker to access unauthorized information or possibly conduct further attacks.
