A vulnerability in the RAR file scanning functionality of Clam AntiVirus (ClamAV) Software versions 0.101.1 and 0.101.0 could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper error-handling mechanisms when processing nested RAR files sent to an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted RAR file to an affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to view or create arbitrary files on the targeted system.
