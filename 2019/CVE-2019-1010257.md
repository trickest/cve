### Description

An Information Disclosure / Data Modification issue exists in article2pdf_getfile.php in the article2pdf Wordpress plugin 0.24, 0.25, 0.26, 0.27. A URL can be constructed which allows overriding the PDF file's path leading to any PDF whose path is known and which is readable to the web server can be downloaded. The file will be deleted after download if the web server has permission to do so. For PHP versions before 5.3, any file can be read by null terminating the string left of the file extension.
