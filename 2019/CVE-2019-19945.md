### Description

uhttpd in OpenWrt through 18.06.5 and 19.x through 19.07.0-rc2 has an integer signedness error. This leads to out-of-bounds access to a heap buffer and a subsequent crash. It can be triggered with an HTTP POST request to a CGI script, specifying both "Transfer-Encoding: chunked" and a large negative Content-Length value.
