### Description

A TLS certificate validation flaw was found in Elastic APM agent for Ruby versions before 2.9.0. When specifying a trusted server CA certificate via the 'server_ca_cert' setting, the Ruby agent would not properly verify the certificate returned by the APM server. This could result in a man in the middle style attack against the Ruby agent.
