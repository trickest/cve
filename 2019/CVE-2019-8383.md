### Description

An issue was discovered in AdvanceCOMP through 2.1. An invalid memory address occurs in the function adv_png_unfilter_8 in lib/png.c. It can be triggered by sending a crafted file to a binary. It allows an attacker to cause a Denial of Service (Segmentation fault) or possibly have unspecified other impact when a victim opens a specially crafted file.
