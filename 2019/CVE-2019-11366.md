### Description

An issue was discovered in atftpd in atftp 0.7.1. It does not lock the thread_list_mutex mutex before assigning the current thread data structure. As a result, the daemon is vulnerable to a denial of service attack due to a NULL pointer dereference. If thread_data is NULL when assigned to current, and modified by another thread before a certain tftpd_list.c check, there is a crash when dereferencing current->next.
