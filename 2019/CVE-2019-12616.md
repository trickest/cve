### Description

An issue was discovered in phpMyAdmin before 4.9.0. A vulnerability was found that allows an attacker to trigger a CSRF attack against a phpMyAdmin user. The attacker can trick the user, for instance through a broken <img> tag pointing at the victim's phpMyAdmin database, and the attacker can potentially deliver a payload (such as a specific INSERT or DELETE statement) to the victim.
