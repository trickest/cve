### Description

In FreeBSD 12.0-STABLE before r350261, 12.0-RELEASE before 12.0-RELEASE-p8, 11.3-STABLE before r350263, 11.3-RELEASE before 11.3-RELEASE-p1, and 11.2-RELEASE before 11.2-RELEASE-p12, system calls operating on file descriptors as part of mqueuefs did not properly release the reference allowing a malicious user to overflow the counter allowing access to files, directories, and sockets opened by processes owned by other users.
