### Description

A vulnerability in Cisco Remote PHY Device Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to execute commands on the underlying Linux shell of an affected device with root privileges. The vulnerability occurs because the affected software improperly sanitizes user-supplied input. An attacker who has valid administrator access to an affected device could exploit this vulnerability by supplying various CLI commands with crafted arguments. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to run arbitrary commands as the root user, allowing complete compromise of the system.
