### Description

Lierda Grill Temperature Monitor V1.00_50006 has a default password of admin for the admin account, which allows an attacker to cause a Denial of Service or Information Disclosure via the undocumented access-point configuration page located on the device. This wifi thermometer app requests and requires excessive permissions to operate such as Fine GPS location, camera, applists, Serial number, IMEI. In addition to the "backdoor" login access for "admin" purposes, this accompanying app also establishes connections with several china based URLs to include Alibaba cloud computing. NOTE: this device also ships with ProGrade branding.
