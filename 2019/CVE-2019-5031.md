### Description

An exploitable memory corruption vulnerability exists in the JavaScript engine of Foxit Software's Foxit PDF Reader, version 9.4.1.16828. A specially crafted PDF document can trigger an out-of-memory condition which isn't handled properly, resulting in arbitrary code execution. An attacker needs to trick the user to open the malicious file to trigger this vulnerability. If the browser plugin extension is enabled, visiting a malicious site can also trigger the vulnerability.
