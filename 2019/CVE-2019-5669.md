### Description

NVIDIA Windows GPU Display Driver contains a vulnerability in the kernel mode layer handler for DxgkDdiEscape in which the software uses a sequential operation to read from or write to a buffer, but it uses an incorrect length value that causes it to access memory that is outside of the bounds of the buffer, which may lead to denial of service or escalation of privileges.
