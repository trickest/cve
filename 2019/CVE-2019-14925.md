### Description

An issue was discovered on Mitsubishi Electric Europe B.V. ME-RTU devices through 2.02 and INEA ME-RTU devices through 3.0. A world-readable /usr/smartrtu/init/settings.xml configuration file on the file system allows an attacker to read sensitive configuration settings such as usernames, passwords, and other sensitive RTU data due to insecure permission assignment.
