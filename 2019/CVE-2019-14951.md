### Description

The Telenav Scout GPS Link app 1.x for iOS, as used with Toyota and Lexus vehicles, has an incorrect protection mechanism against brute-force attacks on the authentication process, which makes it easier for attackers to obtain multimedia-screen access via port 7050 on the cellular network, as demonstrated by a DrivingRestriction method call to uma/jsonrpc/mobile.
