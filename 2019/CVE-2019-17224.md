The web interface of the Compal Broadband CH7465LG modem (version CH7465LG-NCIP-6.12.18.25-2p6-NOSH) is vulnerable to a /%2f/ path traversal attack, which can be exploited in order to test for the existence of a file pathname outside of the web root directory. If a file exists but is not part of the product, there is a 404 error. If a file does not exist, there is a 302 redirect to index.html.
