### Description

On Netis WF2411 with firmware 2.1.36123 and other Netis WF2xxx devices (possibly WF2411 through WF2880), there is a stack-based buffer overflow that does not require authentication. This can cause denial of service (device restart) or remote code execution. This vulnerability can be triggered by a GET request with a long HTTP "Authorization: Basic" header that is mishandled by user_auth->user_ok in /bin/boa.
