### Description

RepetierServer.exe in Repetier-Server 0.8 through 0.91 does not properly validate the XML data structure provided when uploading a new printer configuration. When this is combined with CVE-2019-14450, an attacker can upload an "external command" configuration as a printer configuration, and achieve remote code execution. After exploitation, loading of the external command configuration is dependent on a system reboot or service restart.
