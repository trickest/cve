### Description

** DISPUTED ** A full path disclosure vulnerability was discovered in Matomo v3.9.1 where a user can trigger a particular error to discover the full path of Matomo on the disk, because lastError.file is used in plugins/CorePluginsAdmin/templates/safemode.twig. NOTE: the vendor disputes the significance of this issue, stating "avoid reporting path disclosures, as we don't consider them as security vulnerabilities."
