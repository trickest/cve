### Description

NVIDIA GeForce Experience, all versions prior to 3.20.0.118, contains a vulnerability when GameStream is enabled in which an attacker with local system access can load the Intel graphics driver DLLs without validating the path or signature (also known as a binary planting or DLL preloading attack), which may lead to denial of service, information disclosure, or escalation of privileges through code execution.
