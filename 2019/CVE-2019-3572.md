### Description

An issue was discovered in libming 0.4.8. There is a heap-based buffer over-read in the function writePNG in the file util/dbl2png.c of the dbl2png command-line program. Because this is associated with an erroneous call to png_write_row in libpng, an out-of-bounds write might occur for some memory layouts.
