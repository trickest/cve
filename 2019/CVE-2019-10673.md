### Description

A CSRF vulnerability in a logged-in user's profile edit form in the Ultimate Member plugin before 2.0.40 for WordPress allows attackers to become admin and subsequently extract sensitive information and execute arbitrary code. This occurs because the attacker can change the e-mail address in the administrator profile, and then the attacker is able to reset the administrator password using the WordPress "password forget" form.
