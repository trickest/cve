### Description

An issue was discovered in Tcpreplay 4.3.1. A NULL pointer dereference occurred in the function get_ipv6_l4proto() located at get.c. This can be triggered by sending a crafted pcap file to the tcpreplay-edit binary. It allows an attacker to cause a Denial of Service (Segmentation fault) or possibly have unspecified other impact.
