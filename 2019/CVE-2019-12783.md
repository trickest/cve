### Description

An issue was discovered in Verint Impact 360 15.1. At wfo/control/signin, the rd parameter can accept a URL, to which users will be redirected after a successful login. In conjunction with CVE-2019-12784, this can be used by attackers to "crowdsource" bruteforce login attempts on the target site, allowing them to guess and potentially compromise valid credentials without ever sending any traffic from their own machine to the target site.
