### Description

Virt-install(1) utility used to provision new virtual machines has introduced an option '--unattended' to create VMs without user interaction. This option accepts guest VM password as command line arguments, thus leaking them to others users on the system via process listing. It was introduced recently in the virt-manager v2.2.0 release.
