### Description

A denial of service issue in HTTPD was discovered on MicroDigital N-series cameras with firmware through 6400.0.8.5. An attacker without authorization can upload a file to upload.php with a filename longer than 256 bytes. This will be placed in the updownload area. It will not be deleted, because of a buffer overflow in a Bash command string.
