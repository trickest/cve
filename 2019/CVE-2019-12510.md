### Description

In NETGEAR Nighthawk X10-R900 prior to 1.0.4.26, an attacker may bypass all authentication checks on the device's "NETGEAR Genie" SOAP API ("/soap/server_sa") by supplying a malicious X-Forwarded-For header of the device's LAN IP address (192.168.1.1) in every request. As a result, an attacker may modify almost all of the device's settings and view various configuration settings.
