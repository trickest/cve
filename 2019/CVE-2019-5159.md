### Description

An exploitable improper input validation vulnerability exists in the firmware update functionality of WAGO e!COCKPIT automation software v1.6.0.7. A specially crafted firmware update file can allow an attacker to write arbitrary files to arbitrary locations on WAGO controllers as a part of executing a firmware update, potentially resulting in code execution. An attacker can create a malicious firmware update package file using any zip utility. The user must initiate a firmware update through e!COCKPIT and choose the malicious wup file using the file browser to trigger the vulnerability.
