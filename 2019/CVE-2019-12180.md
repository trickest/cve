### Description

An issue was discovered in SmartBear ReadyAPI through 2.8.2 and 3.0.0 and SoapUI through 5.5. When opening a project, the Groovy "Load Script" is automatically executed. This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary Groovy Language code (Java scripting language) on the victim machine by inducing it to open a malicious Project. The same issue is present in the "Save Script" function, which is executed automatically when saving a project.
