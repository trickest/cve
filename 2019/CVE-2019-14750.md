### Description

An issue was discovered in osTicket before 1.10.7 and 1.12.x before 1.12.1. Stored XSS exists in setup/install.php. It was observed that no input sanitization was provided in the firstname and lastname fields of the application. The insertion of malicious queries in those fields leads to the execution of those queries. This can further lead to cookie stealing or other malicious actions.
