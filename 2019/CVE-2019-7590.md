### Description

ExacqVision Server’s services 'exacqVisionServer', 'dvrdhcpserver' and 'mdnsresponder' have an unquoted service path. If an authenticated user is able to insert code in their system root path it potentially can be executed during the application startup. This could allow the authenticated user to elevate privileges on the system. This issue affects: Exacq Technologies, Inc. exacqVision Server 9.6; 9.8. This issue does not affect: Exacq Technologies, Inc. exacqVision Server version 9.4 and prior versions; 19.03. It is not known whether this issue affects: Exacq Technologies, Inc. exacqVision Server versions prior to 8.4.
