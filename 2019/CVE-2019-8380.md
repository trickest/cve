### Description

An issue was discovered in Bento4 1.5.1-628. A NULL pointer dereference occurs in AP4_Track::GetSampleIndexForTimeStampMs() located in Core/Ap4Track.cpp. It can triggered by sending a crafted file to the mp4audioclip binary. It allows an attacker to cause a Denial of Service (Segmentation fault) or possibly have unspecified other impact.
