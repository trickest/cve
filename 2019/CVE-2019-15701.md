### Description

components/Modals/HelpModal.jsx in BloodHound 2.2.0 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary OS commands (by spawning a child process as the current user on the victim's machine) when the search function's autocomplete feature is used. The victim must import data from an Active Directory with a GPO containing JavaScript in its name.
