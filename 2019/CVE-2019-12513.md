### Description

In NETGEAR Nighthawk X10-R900 prior to 1.0.4.24, by sending a DHCP discover request containing a malicious hostname field, an attacker may execute stored XSS attacks against this device. When the malicious DHCP request is received, the device will generate a log entry containing the malicious hostname. This log entry may then be viewed at Advanced settings->Administration->Logs to trigger the exploit. Although this value is inserted into a textarea tag, converted to all-caps, and limited in length, attacks are still possible.
