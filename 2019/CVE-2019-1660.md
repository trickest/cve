### Description

A vulnerability in the Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) of Cisco TelePresence Management Suite (TMS) software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to gain unauthorized access to an affected device. The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper access and authentication controls on the affected TMS software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by gaining access to internal, trusted networks to send crafted SOAP calls to the affected device. If successful, an exploit could allow the attacker to access system management tools. Under normal circumstances, this access should be prohibited.
