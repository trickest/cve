### Description

Crestron AM-100 with firmware 1.6.0.2 and AM-101 with firmware 2.7.0.2 stores usernames, passwords, and other configuration options in the file generated via the "export configuration" feature. The configuration file is encrypted using the awenc binary. The same binary can be used to decrypt any configuration file since all the encryption logic is hard coded. A local attacker can use this vulnerability to gain access to devices username and passwords.
