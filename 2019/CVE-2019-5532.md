### Description

VMware vCenter Server (6.7.x prior to 6.7 U3, 6.5 prior to 6.5 U3 and 6.0 prior to 6.0 U3j) contains an information disclosure vulnerability due to the logging of credentials in plain-text for virtual machines deployed through OVF. A malicious user with access to the log files containing vCenter OVF-properties of a virtual machine deployed from an OVF may be able to view the credentials used to deploy the OVF (typically the root account of the virtual machine).
