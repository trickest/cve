### Description

NETSAS Enigma NMS 65.0.0 and prior suffers from a directory traversal vulnerability that can allow an authenticated user to access files and directories stored outside of the web root folder. By exploiting this vulnerability, it is possible for an attacker to list operating-system directory contents on the server, create directories and upload files in permissible locations, and modify filenames and delete files that are accessible by the user running the web server instance.
