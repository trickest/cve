### Description

An issue was discovered in Bento4 1.5.1-628. A NULL pointer dereference occurs in the function AP4_List:Find located in Core/Ap4List.h when called from Core/Ap4Movie.cpp. It can be triggered by sending a crafted file to the mp4dump binary. It allows an attacker to cause a Denial of Service (Segmentation fault) or possibly have unspecified other impact.
