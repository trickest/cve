### Description

An issue was discovered on Alcatel-Lucent OmniVista 4760 devices. A remote unauthenticated attacker can chain a directory traversal (which helps to bypass authentication) with an insecure file upload to achieve Remote Code Execution as SYSTEM. The directory traversal is in the __construct() whereas the insecure file upload is in SetSkinImages().
