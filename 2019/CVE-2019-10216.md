### Description

In ghostscript before version 9.50, the .buildfont1 procedure did not properly secure its privileged calls, enabling scripts to bypass `-dSAFER` restrictions. An attacker could abuse this flaw by creating a specially crafted PostScript file that could escalate privileges and access files outside of restricted areas.
