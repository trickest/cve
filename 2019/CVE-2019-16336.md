### Description

The Bluetooth Low Energy implementation in Cypress PSoC 4 BLE component 3.61 and earlier processes data channel frames with a payload length larger than the configured link layer maximum RX payload size, which allows attackers (in radio range) to cause a denial of service (crash) via a crafted BLE Link Layer frame.
