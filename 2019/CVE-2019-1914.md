### Description

A vulnerability in the web management interface of Cisco Small Business 220 Series Smart Switches could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to perform a command injection attack. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious request to certain parts of the web management interface. To send the malicious request, the attacker needs a valid login session in the web management interface as a privilege level 15 user. Depending on the configuration of the affected switch, the malicious request must be sent via HTTP or HTTPS. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary shell commands with the privileges of the root user.
