### Description

A vulnerability in the seccomp filters of Canonical snapd before version 2.37.4 allows a strict mode snap to insert characters into a terminal on a 64-bit host. The seccomp rules were generated to match 64-bit ioctl(2) commands on a 64-bit platform; however, the Linux kernel only uses the lower 32 bits to determine which ioctl(2) commands to run. This issue affects: Canonical snapd versions prior to 2.37.4.
