### Description

A vulnerability in the London Trust Media Private Internet Access (PIA) VPN Client v82 for Linux and macOS could allow an authenticated, local attacker to overwrite arbitrary files. The openvpn_launcher binary is setuid root. This binary supports the --log option, which accepts a path as an argument. This parameter is not sanitized, which allows a local unprivileged user to overwrite arbitrary files owned by any user on the system, including root. This creates a denial of service condition and possible data loss if leveraged by a malicious local user.
