### Description

An issue was discovered in Bento4 1.5.1-628. An out of bounds write occurs in AP4_CttsTableEntry::AP4_CttsTableEntry() located in Core/Ap4Array.h. It can be triggered by sending a crafted file to (for example) the mp42hls binary. It allows an attacker to cause Denial of Service (Segmentation fault) or possibly have unspecified other impact.
