### Description

The SHAREit application before 4.0.42 for Android allows a remote attacker (on the same network or joining public "open" Wi-Fi hotspots created by the application when file transfer is initiated) to download arbitrary files from the device including contacts, photos, videos, sound clips, etc. The attacker must be authenticated as a "recognized device."
