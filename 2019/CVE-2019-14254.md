### Description

An issue was discovered in the secure portal in Publisure 2.1.2. Because SQL queries are not well sanitized, there are multiple SQL injections in userAccFunctions.php functions. Using this, an attacker can access passwords and/or grant access to the user account "user" in order to become "Administrator" (for example).
