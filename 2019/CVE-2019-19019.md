### Description

An issue was discovered in TitanHQ WebTitan before 5.18. It contains a Remote Code Execution issue through which an attacker can execute arbitrary code as root. The issue stems from the hotfix download mechanism, which downloads a shell script via HTTP, and then executes it as root. This is analogous to CVE-2019-6800 but for a different product.
