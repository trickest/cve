### Description

A file-read vulnerability was identified in the Wi-Fi transfer feature of Musicloud 1.6. By default, the application runs a transfer service on port 8080, accessible by everyone on the same Wi-Fi network. An attacker can send the POST parameters downfiles and cur-folder (with a crafted ../ payload) to the download.script endpoint. This will create a MusicPlayerArchive.zip archive that is publicly accessible and includes the content of any requested file (such as the /etc/passwd file).
