### Description

OpenSSL before 0.9.8k on WIN64 and certain other platforms does not properly handle a malformed ASN.1 structure, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (invalid memory access and application crash) by placing this structure in the public key of a certificate, as demonstrated by an RSA public key.
