### Description

Directory traversal vulnerability in plugins/ddb/foot.php in Strawberry 1.1.1 allows remote attackers to include and execute arbitrary local files via a .. (dot dot) in the file parameter to example/index.php.  NOTE: this was originally reported as an issue affecting the do parameter, but traversal with that parameter might depend on a modified example/index.php.  NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third party information.
