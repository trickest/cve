### Description

CRLF injection vulnerability in the Forgot Password implementation in server/webmail.php in IceWarp eMail Server and WebMail Server before 9.4.2 makes it easier for remote attackers to trick a user into disclosing credentials via CRLF sequences preceding a Reply-To header in the subject element of an XML document, as demonstrated by triggering an e-mail message from the server that contains a user's correct credentials, and requests that the user compose a reply that includes this message.
