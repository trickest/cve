### Description

The jar: URI implementation in Mozilla Firefox before 3.0.9, Thunderbird, and SeaMonkey does not follow the Content-Disposition header of the inner URI, which allows remote attackers to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks and possibly other attacks via an uploaded .jar file with a "Content-Disposition: attachment" designation.
