### Description

Integer overflow in cdd.dll in the Canonical Display Driver (CDD) in Microsoft Windows Server 2008 R2 and Windows 7 on 64-bit platforms, when the Windows Aero theme is installed, allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (reboot) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted image file that triggers incorrect data parsing after user-mode data is copied to kernel mode, as demonstrated using "Browse with Irfanview" and certain actions on a folder containing a large number of thumbnail images in Resample mode, possibly related to the ATI graphics driver or win32k.sys, aka "Canonical Display Driver Integer Overflow Vulnerability."
