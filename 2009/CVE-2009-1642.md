### Description

Multiple stack-based buffer overflows in Mini-stream ASX to MP3 Converter 3.0.0.7 allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via (1) a long rtsp URL in a .ram file and (2) a long string in the HREF attribute of a REF element in a .asx file.  NOTE: the latter was also subsequently reported in "prior to 3.1.3.7."
