### Description

NOS Microsystems getPlus Download Manager, as used in Adobe Reader 1.6.2.36 and possibly other versions, Corel getPlus Download Manager before 1.5.0.48, and possibly other products, installs NOS\bin\getPlus_HelperSvc.exe with insecure permissions (Everyone:Full Control), which allows local users to gain SYSTEM privileges by replacing getPlus_HelperSvc.exe with a Trojan horse program, as demonstrated by use of getPlus Download Manager within Adobe Reader. NOTE: within Adobe Reader, the scope of this issue is limited because the program is deleted and the associated service is not automatically launched after a successful installation and reboot.
