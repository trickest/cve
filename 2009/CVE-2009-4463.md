### Description

Intellicom NetBiter WebSCADA devices use default passwords for the HICP network configuration service, which makes it easier for remote attackers to modify network settings and cause a denial of service. NOTE: this is only a vulnerability when the administrator does not follow recommendations in the product's installation documentation. NOTE: this issue was originally reported to be hard-coded passwords, not default passwords.
