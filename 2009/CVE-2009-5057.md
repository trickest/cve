### Description

The S/MIME feature in Open Ticket Request System (OTRS) before 2.3.4 does not configure the RANDFILE and HOME environment variables for OpenSSL, which might make it easier for remote attackers to decrypt e-mail messages that had lower than intended entropy available for cryptographic operations, related to inability to write to the seeding file.
