### Description

Multiple unspecified vulnerabilities in Intel system software for Trusted Execution Technology (TXT) allow attackers to bypass intended loader integrity protections, as demonstrated by exploitation of tboot.  NOTE: as of 20090107, the only disclosure is a vague pre-advisory with no actionable information. However, because it is from a well-known researcher, it is being assigned a CVE identifier for tracking purposes.
