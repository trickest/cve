### Description

Microsoft Windows does not properly enforce the Autorun and NoDriveTypeAutoRun registry values, which allows physically proximate attackers to execute arbitrary code by (1) inserting CD-ROM media, (2) inserting DVD media, (3) connecting a USB device, and (4) connecting a Firewire device; (5) allows user-assisted remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by mapping a network drive; and allows user-assisted attackers to execute arbitrary code by clicking on (6) an icon under My Computer\Devices with Removable Storage and (7) an option in an AutoPlay dialog, related to the Autorun.inf file.  NOTE: vectors 1 and 3 on Vista are already covered by CVE-2008-0951.
