### Description

Directory traversal vulnerability in html2ps before 1.0b6 allows remote attackers to read arbitrary files via a .. (dot dot) in the "include file" SSI directive.  NOTE: this issue only might be a vulnerability in limited scenarios, such as if html2ps is invoked by a web application, or if a user-assisted attacker provides filenames whose contents could cause a denial of service, such as certain devices.
