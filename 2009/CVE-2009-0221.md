### Description

Integer overflow in Microsoft Office PowerPoint 2002 SP3 and 2003 SP3 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a PowerPoint file containing a crafted record type for "collaboration information for different slides" that contains a field that specifies a large number of records, which triggers an under-allocated buffer and a heap-based buffer overflow, aka "Integer Overflow Vulnerability."
