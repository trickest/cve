### Description

Opera before 10.01 does not properly restrict HTML in a (1) RSS or (2) Atom feed, which allows remote attackers to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, and conduct cross-zone scripting attacks involving the Feed Subscription Page to read feeds or create feed subscriptions, via a crafted feed, related to the rendering of the application/rss+xml content type as "scripted content."
