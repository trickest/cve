### Description

Stack-based buffer overflow in the GetStatsFromLine function in TPTEST 3.1.7 and earlier, and possibly 5.02, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a STATS line with a long pwd field.  NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third party information.
