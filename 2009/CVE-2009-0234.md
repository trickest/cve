### Description

The DNS Resolver Cache Service (aka DNSCache) in Windows DNS Server in Microsoft Windows 2000 SP4, Server 2003 SP1 and SP2, and Server 2008 does not properly cache crafted DNS responses, which makes it easier for remote attackers to predict transaction IDs and poison caches by sending many crafted DNS queries that trigger "unnecessary lookups," aka "DNS Server Response Validation Vulnerability."
