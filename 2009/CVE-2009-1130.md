### Description

Heap-based buffer overflow in Microsoft Office PowerPoint 2002 SP3 and 2003 SP3, and PowerPoint in Microsoft Office 2004 for Mac, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted structure in a Notes container in a PowerPoint file that causes PowerPoint to read more data than was allocated when creating a C++ object, leading to an overwrite of a function pointer, aka "Heap Corruption Vulnerability."
