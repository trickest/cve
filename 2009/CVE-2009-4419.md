### Description

Intel Q35, GM45, PM45 Express, Q45, and Q43 Express chipsets in the SINIT Authenticated Code Module (ACM), which allows local users to bypass the Trusted Execution Technology protection mechanism and gain privileges by modifying the MCHBAR register to point to an attacker-controlled region, which prevents the SENTER instruction from properly applying VT-d protection while an MLE is being loaded.
