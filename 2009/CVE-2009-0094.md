### Description

The WINS server in Microsoft Windows 2000 SP4 and Server 2003 SP1 and SP2 does not restrict registration of the (1) "wpad" and (2) "isatap" NetBIOS names, which allows remote authenticated users to hijack the Web Proxy Auto-Discovery (WPAD) and Intra-Site Automatic Tunnel Addressing Protocol (ISATAP) features, and conduct man-in-the-middle attacks by spoofing a proxy server or ISATAP route, by registering one of these names in the WINS database, aka "WPAD WINS Server Registration Vulnerability," a related issue to CVE-2007-1692.
