### Description

_functions.php in cpCommerce 1.2.x, possibly including 1.2.9, sends a redirect but does not exit when it is called directly, which allows remote attackers to bypass a protection mechanism to conduct remote file inclusion and directory traversal attacks, execute arbitrary PHP code, or read arbitrary files via the GLOBALS[prefix] parameter, a different vector than CVE-2003-1500.
