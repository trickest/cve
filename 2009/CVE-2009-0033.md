### Description

Apache Tomcat 4.1.0 through 4.1.39, 5.5.0 through 5.5.27, and 6.0.0 through 6.0.18, when the Java AJP connector and mod_jk load balancing are used, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application outage) via a crafted request with invalid headers, related to temporary blocking of connectors that have encountered errors, as demonstrated by an error involving a malformed HTTP Host header.
