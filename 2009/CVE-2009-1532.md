### Description

Microsoft Internet Explorer 8 for Windows XP SP2 and SP3; 8 for Server 2003 SP2; 8 for Vista Gold, SP1, and SP2; and 8 for Server 2008 SP2 does not properly handle objects in memory, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via "malformed row property references" that trigger an access of an object that (1) was not properly initialized or (2) is deleted, leading to memory corruption, aka "HTML Objects Memory Corruption Vulnerability" or "HTML Object Memory Corruption Vulnerability."
