### Description

Open Scripting Architecture in Apple Mac OS X 10.4.11 and 10.5.4, and some other 10.4 and 10.5 versions, does not properly restrict the loading of scripting addition plugins, which allows local users to gain privileges via scripting addition commands to a privileged application, as originally demonstrated by an osascript tell command to ARDAgent.
