### Description

Integer overflow in the Open function in modules/demux/tta.c in VLC Media Player 0.8.6i allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted TTA file, which triggers a heap-based buffer overflow.  NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third party information.
