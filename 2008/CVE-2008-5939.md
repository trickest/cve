### Description

Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in index.php in MODx CMS 0.9.6.2 and earlier allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via a JavaScript event in the username field, possibly related to snippet.ditto.php.  NOTE: some sources list the id parameter as being affected, but this is probably incorrect based on the original disclosure.
