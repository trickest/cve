### Description

SQL injection vulnerability in Load.php in Simple Machines Forum (SMF) 1.1.4 and earlier allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands by setting the db_character_set parameter to a multibyte character set such as big5, which causes the addslashes PHP function to produce a "\" (backslash) sequence that does not quote the "'" (single quote) character, as demonstrated via a manlabels action to index.php.
