### Description

The WordPad Text Converter for Word 97 files in Microsoft Windows 2000 SP4, XP SP2, and Server 2003 SP1 and SP2 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted (1) .doc, (2) .wri, or (3) .rtf Word 97 file that triggers memory corruption, as exploited in the wild in December 2008.  NOTE: As of 20081210, it is unclear whether this vulnerability is related to a WordPad issue disclosed on 20080925 with a 2008-crash.doc.rar example, but there are insufficient details to be sure.
