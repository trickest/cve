### Description

The nonet and nointernet sandbox profiles in Apple Mac OS X 10.5.x do not propagate restrictions to all created processes, which allows remote attackers to access network resources via a crafted application, as demonstrated by use of launchctl to trigger the launchd daemon's execution of a script file, a related issue to CVE-2011-1516.
