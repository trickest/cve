### Description

Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007 Gold and SP1 and Microsoft Search Server 2008 do not properly perform authentication and authorization for administrative functions, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (server load), obtain sensitive information, and "create scripts that would run in the context of the site" via requests to administrative URIs, aka "Access Control Vulnerability."
