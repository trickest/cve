### Description

Buffer overflow in the SQLVDIRLib.SQLVDirControl ActiveX control in Tools\Binn\sqlvdir.dll in Microsoft SQL Server 2000 (aka SQL Server 8.0) allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (browser crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a long URL in the second argument to the Connect method.  NOTE: this issue is not a vulnerability in many environments, since the control is not marked as safe for scripting and would not execute with default Internet Explorer settings.
