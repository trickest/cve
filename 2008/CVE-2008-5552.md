### Description

The XSS Filter in Microsoft Internet Explorer 8.0 Beta 2 allows remote attackers to bypass the XSS protection mechanism and conduct XSS attacks via a CRLF sequence in conjunction with a crafted Content-Type header, as demonstrated by a header with a utf-7 charset value.  NOTE: the vendor has reportedly stated that the XSS Filter intentionally does not attempt to "address every conceivable XSS attack scenario."
