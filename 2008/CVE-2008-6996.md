### Description

Google Chrome BETA (0.2.149.27) does not prompt the user before saving an executable file, which makes it easier for remote attackers or malware to cause a denial of service (disk consumption) or exploit other vulnerabilities via a URL that references an executable file, possibly related to the "ask where to save each file before downloading" setting.
