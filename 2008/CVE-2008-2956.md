### Description

Memory leak in Pidgin 2.0.0, and possibly other versions, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via malformed XML documents. NOTE: this issue has been disputed by the upstream vendor, who states: "I was never able to identify a scenario under which a problem occurred and the original reporter wasn't able to supply any sort of reproduction details."
