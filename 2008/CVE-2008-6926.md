### Description

Directory traversal vulnerability in autoinstall4imagesgalleryupgrade.php in the Fantastico De Luxe Module for cPanel allows remote attackers to include and execute arbitrary local files via directory traversal sequences in the scriptpath_show parameter in a GoAhead action.  NOTE: this issue only crosses privilege boundaries when security settings such as disable_functions and safe_mode are active, since exploitation requires uploading of executable code to a home directory.
