### Description

Timbuktu Pro 8.6.5 for Windows, and possibly 8.7 for Mac OS X, does not perform input validation before logging information fields taken from packets from a remote peer, which allows remote attackers to generate crafted log entries, and possibly avoid detection of attacks, via modified (1) computer name, (2) user name, and (3) IP address fields.
