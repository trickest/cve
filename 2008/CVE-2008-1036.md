### Description

The International Components for Unicode (ICU) library in Apple Mac OS X before 10.5.3, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, and other operating systems omits some invalid character sequences during conversion of some character encodings, which might allow remote attackers to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
