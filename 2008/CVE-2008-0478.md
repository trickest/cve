### Description

Directory traversal vulnerability in index.php in SetCMS 3.6.5 allows remote attackers to include and execute arbitrary local files via a .. (dot dot) in the set parameter, as demonstrated by sending a certain CLIENT_IP HTTP header in an enter action to index.php, and injecting PHP sequences into files/enter.set, which is then included by index.php.
