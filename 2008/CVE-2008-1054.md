### Description

Stack-based buffer overflow in the _lib_spawn_user_getpid function in (1) swatch.exe and (2) surgemail.exe in NetWin SurgeMail 38k4 and earlier, and beta 39a, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via an HTTP request with multiple long headers to webmail.exe and unspecified other CGI executables, which triggers an overflow when assigning values to environment variables.  NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third party information.
