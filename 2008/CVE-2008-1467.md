### Description

CenterIM 4.22.3 and earlier allows user-assisted remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via shell metacharacters in a URI, related to "received URLs in the message window."  NOTE: this issue has been disputed due to the user-assisted nature, since the URL must be selected and launched by the victim
