### Description

Akeeba Restore (restore.php), as used in Joomla! 2.5.4 through 2.5.25, 3.x through 3.2.5, and 3.3.0 through 3.3.4; Akeeba Backup for Joomla! Professional 3.0.0 through 4.0.2; Backup Professional for WordPress 1.0.b1 through 1.1.3; Solo 1.0.b1 through 1.1.2; Admin Tools Core and Professional 2.0.0 through 2.4.4; and CMS Update 1.0.a1 through 1.0.1, when performing a backup or update for an archive, does not delete parameters from $_GET and $_POST when it is cleansing $_REQUEST, but later accesses $_GET and $_POST using the getQueryParam function, which allows remote attackers to bypass encryption and execute arbitrary code via a command message that extracts a crafted archive.
