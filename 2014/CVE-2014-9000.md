### Description

Mule Enterprise Management Console (MMC) does not properly restrict access to handler/securityService.rpc, which allows remote authenticated users to gain administrator privileges and execute arbitrary code via a crafted request that adds a new user.  NOTE: this issue was originally reported for ESB Runtime 3.5.1, but it originates in MMC.
