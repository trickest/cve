### Description

The read_network_packet function in ntp_io.c in ntpd in NTP 4.x before 4.2.8p1 on Linux and OS X does not properly determine whether a source IP address is an IPv6 loopback address, which makes it easier for remote attackers to spoof restricted packets, and read or write to the runtime state, by leveraging the ability to reach the ntpd machine's network interface with a packet from the ::1 address.
