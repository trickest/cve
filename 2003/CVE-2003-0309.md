### Description

Internet Explorer 5.01, 5.5, and 6.0 allows remote attackers to bypass security zone restrictions and execute arbitrary programs via a web document with a large number of duplicate file:// or other requests that point to the program and open multiple file download dialogs, which eventually cause Internet Explorer to execute the program, as demonstrated using a large number of FRAME or IFRAME tags, aka the "File Download Dialog Vulnerability."
