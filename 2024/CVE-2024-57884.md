### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:mm: vmscan: account for free pages to prevent infinite Loop in throttle_direct_reclaim()The task sometimes continues looping in throttle_direct_reclaim() becauseallow_direct_reclaim(pgdat) keeps returning false.   #0 [ffff80002cb6f8d0] __switch_to at ffff8000080095ac #1 [ffff80002cb6f900] __schedule at ffff800008abbd1c #2 [ffff80002cb6f990] schedule at ffff800008abc50c #3 [ffff80002cb6f9b0] throttle_direct_reclaim at ffff800008273550 #4 [ffff80002cb6fa20] try_to_free_pages at ffff800008277b68 #5 [ffff80002cb6fae0] __alloc_pages_nodemask at ffff8000082c4660 #6 [ffff80002cb6fc50] alloc_pages_vma at ffff8000082e4a98 #7 [ffff80002cb6fca0] do_anonymous_page at ffff80000829f5a8 #8 [ffff80002cb6fce0] __handle_mm_fault at ffff8000082a5974 #9 [ffff80002cb6fd90] handle_mm_fault at ffff8000082a5bd4At this point, the pgdat contains the following two zones:        NODE: 4  ZONE: 0  ADDR: ffff00817fffe540  NAME: "DMA32"          SIZE: 20480  MIN/LOW/HIGH: 11/28/45          VM_STAT:                NR_FREE_PAGES: 359        NR_ZONE_INACTIVE_ANON: 18813          NR_ZONE_ACTIVE_ANON: 0        NR_ZONE_INACTIVE_FILE: 50          NR_ZONE_ACTIVE_FILE: 0          NR_ZONE_UNEVICTABLE: 0        NR_ZONE_WRITE_PENDING: 0                     NR_MLOCK: 0                    NR_BOUNCE: 0                   NR_ZSPAGES: 0            NR_FREE_CMA_PAGES: 0        NODE: 4  ZONE: 1  ADDR: ffff00817fffec00  NAME: "Normal"          SIZE: 8454144  PRESENT: 98304  MIN/LOW/HIGH: 68/166/264          VM_STAT:                NR_FREE_PAGES: 146        NR_ZONE_INACTIVE_ANON: 94668          NR_ZONE_ACTIVE_ANON: 3        NR_ZONE_INACTIVE_FILE: 735          NR_ZONE_ACTIVE_FILE: 78          NR_ZONE_UNEVICTABLE: 0        NR_ZONE_WRITE_PENDING: 0                     NR_MLOCK: 0                    NR_BOUNCE: 0                   NR_ZSPAGES: 0            NR_FREE_CMA_PAGES: 0In allow_direct_reclaim(), while processing ZONE_DMA32, the sum ofinactive/active file-backed pages calculated in zone_reclaimable_pages()based on the result of zone_page_state_snapshot() is zero.  Additionally, since this system lacks swap, the calculation of inactive/active anonymous pages is skipped.        crash> p nr_swap_pages        nr_swap_pages = $1937 = {          counter = 0        }As a result, ZONE_DMA32 is deemed unreclaimable and skipped, moving on tothe processing of the next zone, ZONE_NORMAL, despite ZONE_DMA32 havingfree pages significantly exceeding the high watermark.The problem is that the pgdat->kswapd_failures hasn't been incremented.        crash> px ((struct pglist_data *) 0xffff00817fffe540)->kswapd_failures        $1935 = 0x0This is because the node deemed balanced.  The node balancing logic inbalance_pgdat() evaluates all zones collectively.  If one or more zones(e.g., ZONE_DMA32) have enough free pages to meet their watermarks, theentire node is deemed balanced.  This causes balance_pgdat() to exit earlybefore incrementing the kswapd_failures, as it considers the overallmemory state acceptable, even though some zones (like ZONE_NORMAL) remainunder significant pressure.The patch ensures that zone_reclaimable_pages() includes free pages(NR_FREE_PAGES) in its calculation when no other reclaimable pages areavailable (e.g., file-backed or anonymous pages).  This change preventszones like ZONE_DMA32, which have sufficient free pages, from beingmistakenly deemed unreclaimable.  By doing so, the patch ensures propernode balancing, avoids masking pressure on other zones like ZONE_NORMAL,and prevents infinite loops in throttle_direct_reclaim() caused byallow_direct_reclaim(pgdat) repeatedly returning false.The kernel hangs due to a task stuck in throttle_direct_reclaim(), causedby a node being incorrectly deemed balanced despite pressure in certainzones, such as ZONE_NORMAL.  This issue arises fromzone_reclaimable_pages---truncated---
