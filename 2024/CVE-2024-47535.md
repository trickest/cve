### Description

Netty is an asynchronous event-driven network application framework for rapid development of maintainable high performance protocol servers & clients. An unsafe reading of environment file could potentially cause a denial of service in Netty. When loaded on an Windows application, Netty attempts to load a file that does not exist. If an attacker creates such a large file, the Netty application crashes. This vulnerability is fixed in 4.1.115.
