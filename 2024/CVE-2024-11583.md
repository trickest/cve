### Description

The Borderless – Widgets, Elements, Templates and Toolkit for Elementor & Gutenberg plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized loss of data due to a missing capability check on the 'remove_zipped_font' function in all versions up to, and including, 1.5.9. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to delete icon fonts that were previously uploaded.
