### Description

The AcyMailing – An Ultimate Newsletter Plugin and Marketing Automation Solution for WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the acym_extractArchive function in all versions up to, and including, 9.7.2. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.
