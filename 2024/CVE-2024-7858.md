### Description

The Media Library Folders plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access due to missing capability checks on several AJAX functions in the media-library-plus.php file in all versions up to, and including, 8.2.3. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to perform several actions related to managing media files and folder along with controlling settings.
