### Description

The Social Icons Widget & Block by WPZOOM WordPress plugin before 4.2.18 does not sanitise and escape some of its Widget settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)
