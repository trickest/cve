### Description

Miniconda3 macOS installers before 23.11.0-1 contain a local privilege escalation vulnerability when installed outside the user's home directory. During installation, world-writable files are created and executed with root privileges. This flaw allows a local low-privileged user to inject arbitrary commands, leading to code execution as the root user.
