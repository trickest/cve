### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:erofs: handle NONHEAD !delta[1] lclusters gracefullysyzbot reported a WARNING in iomap_iter_done: iomap_fiemap+0x73b/0x9b0 fs/iomap/fiemap.c:80 ioctl_fiemap fs/ioctl.c:220 [inline]Generally, NONHEAD lclusters won't have delta[1]==0, except for craftedimages and filesystems created by pre-1.0 mkfs versions.Previously, it would immediately bail out if delta[1]==0, which led toinadequate decompressed lengths (thus FIEMAP is impacted).  Treat it asdelta[1]=1 to work around these legacy mkfs versions.`lclusterbits > 14` is illegal for compact indexes, error out too.
