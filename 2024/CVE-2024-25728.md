### Description

ExpressVPN before 12.73.0 on Windows, when split tunneling is used, sends DNS requests according to the Windows configuration (e.g., sends them to DNS servers operated by the user's ISP instead of to the ExpressVPN DNS servers), which may allow remote attackers to obtain sensitive information about websites visited by VPN users.
