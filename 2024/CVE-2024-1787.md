### Description

The Contests by Rewards Fuel plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the 'update_rewards_fuel_api_key' parameter in all versions up to, and including, 2.0.64 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
