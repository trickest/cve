### Description

Ampache, a web based audio/video streaming application and file manager, has a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in versions prior to 6.6.0. This vulnerability exists in the "Playlists - Democratic - Configure Democratic Playlist" feature. An attacker with Content Manager permissions can set the Name field to `<svg onload=alert(8)>`. When any administrator or user accesses the Democratic functionality, they will be affected by this stored XSS vulnerability. The attacker can exploit this vulnerability to obtain the cookies of any user or administrator who accesses the `democratic.php` file. Version 6.6.0 contains a patch for the issue.
