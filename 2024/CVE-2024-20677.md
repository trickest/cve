### Description

A security vulnerability exists in FBX that could lead to remote code execution. To mitigate this vulnerability, the ability to insert FBX files has been disabled in Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Outlook for Windows and Mac. Versions of Office that had this feature enabled will no longer have access to it. This includes Office 2019, Office 2021, Office LTSC for Mac 2021, and Microsoft 365. As of February 13, 2024, the ability to insert FBX files has also been disabled in 3D Viewer.3D models in Office documents that were previously inserted from a FBX file will continue to work as expected unless the Link to File option was chosen at insert time.This change is effective as of the January 9, 2024 security update.
