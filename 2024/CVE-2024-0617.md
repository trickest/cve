### Description

The Category Discount Woocommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the wpcd_save_discount() function in all versions up to, and including, 4.12. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify product category discounts that could lead to loss of revenue.
