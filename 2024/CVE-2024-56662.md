### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:acpi: nfit: vmalloc-out-of-bounds Read in acpi_nfit_ctlFix an issue detected by syzbot with KASAN:BUG: KASAN: vmalloc-out-of-bounds in cmd_to_func drivers/acpi/nfit/core.c:416 [inline]BUG: KASAN: vmalloc-out-of-bounds in acpi_nfit_ctl+0x20e8/0x24a0drivers/acpi/nfit/core.c:459The issue occurs in cmd_to_func when the call_pkg->nd_reserved2array is accessed without verifying that call_pkg points to a bufferthat is appropriately sized as a struct nd_cmd_pkg. This can leadto out-of-bounds access and undefined behavior if the buffer does nothave sufficient space.To address this, a check was added in acpi_nfit_ctl() to ensure thatbuf is not NULL and that buf_len is less than sizeof(*call_pkg)before accessing it. This ensures safe access to the members ofcall_pkg, including the nd_reserved2 array.
