### Description

TEM Opera Plus FM Family Transmitter allows access to an unprotected endpoint that allows MPFS File System binary image upload without authentication. This file system serves as the basis for the HTTP2 web server module but is also used by the SNMP module and is available to other applications that require basic read-only storage capabilities. This can be exploited to overwrite the flash program memory that holds the web server's main interfaces and execute arbitrary code.
