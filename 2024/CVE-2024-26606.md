### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:binder: signal epoll threads of self-workIn (e)poll mode, threads often depend on I/O events to determine whendata is ready for consumption. Within binder, a thread may initiate acommand via BINDER_WRITE_READ without a read buffer and then make useof epoll_wait() or similar to consume any responses afterwards.It is then crucial that epoll threads are signaled via wakeup when theyqueue their own work. Otherwise, they risk waiting indefinitely for anevent leaving their work unhandled. What is worse, subsequent commandswon't trigger a wakeup either as the thread has pending work.
