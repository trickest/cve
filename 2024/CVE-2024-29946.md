### Description

In Splunk Enterprise versions below 9.2.1, 9.1.4, and 9.0.9, the Dashboard Examples Hub in the Splunk Dashboard Studio app lacks protections for risky SPL commands. This could let attackers bypass SPL safeguards for risky commands in the Hub. The vulnerability would require the attacker to phish the victim by tricking them into initiating a request within their browser.
