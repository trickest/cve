### Description

The Blogmentor – Blog Layouts for Elementor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the ‘pagination_style’ parameter in all versions up to, and including, 1.5 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
