### Description

ThreeTen Backport v1.6.8 was discovered to contain a NullPointerException via the component org.threeten.bp.LocalDate::compareTo(ChronoLocalDate). NOTE: this is disputed by multiple third parties who believe there was not reasonable evidence to determine the existence of a vulnerability. The submission may have been based on a tool that is not sufficiently robust for vulnerability identification.
