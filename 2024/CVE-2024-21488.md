### Description

Versions of the package network before 0.7.0 are vulnerable to Arbitrary Command Injection due to use of the child_process exec function without input sanitization. If (attacker-controlled) user input is given to the mac_address_for function of the package, it is possible for the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the operating system that this package is being run on.
