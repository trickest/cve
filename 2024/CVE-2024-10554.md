### Description

The WordPress WP-Advanced-Search WordPress plugin before 3.3.9.3 does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup).
