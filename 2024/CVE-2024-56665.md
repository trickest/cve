### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:bpf,perf: Fix invalid prog_array access in perf_event_detach_bpf_progSyzbot reported [1] crash that happens for following tracing scenario:  - create tracepoint perf event with attr.inherit=1, attach it to the    process and set bpf program to it  - attached process forks -> chid creates inherited event    the new child event shares the parent's bpf program and tp_event    (hence prog_array) which is global for tracepoint  - exit both process and its child -> release both events  - first perf_event_detach_bpf_prog call will release tp_event->prog_array    and second perf_event_detach_bpf_prog will crash, because    tp_event->prog_array is NULLThe fix makes sure the perf_event_detach_bpf_prog checks prog_arrayis valid before it tries to remove the bpf program from it.[1] https://lore.kernel.org/bpf/Z1MR6dCIKajNS6nU@krava/T/#m91dbf0688221ec7a7fc95e896a7ef9ff93b0b8ad
