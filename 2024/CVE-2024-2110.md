### Description

The Events Manager – Calendar, Bookings, Tickets, and more! plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 6.4.7.1. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on several actions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify booking statuses via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
