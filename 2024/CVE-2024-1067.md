### Description

Use After Free vulnerability in Arm Ltd Bifrost GPU Kernel Driver, Arm Ltd Valhall GPU Kernel Driver, Arm Ltd Arm 5th Gen GPU Architecture Kernel Driver allows a local non-privileged user to make improper GPU memory processing operations. On Armv8.0 cores, there are certain combinations of the Linux Kernel and Mali GPU kernel driver configurations that would allow the GPU operations to affect the userspace memory of other processes.This issue affects Bifrost GPU Kernel Driver: from r41p0 through r47p0; Valhall GPU Kernel Driver: from r41p0 through r47p0; Arm 5th Gen GPU Architecture Kernel Driver: from r41p0 through r47p0.
