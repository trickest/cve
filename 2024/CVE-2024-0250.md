### Description

The Analytics Insights for Google Analytics 4 (AIWP) WordPress plugin before 6.3 is vulnerable to Open Redirect due to insufficient validation on the redirect oauth2callback.php file. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to redirect users to potentially malicious sites if they can successfully trick them into performing an action.
