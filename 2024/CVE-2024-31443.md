### Description

Cacti provides an operational monitoring and fault management framework. Prior to 1.2.27, some of the data stored in `form_save()` function in `data_queries.php` is not thoroughly checked and is used to concatenate the HTML statement in `grow_right_pane_tree()` function from `lib/html.php` , finally resulting in cross-site scripting. Version 1.2.27 contains a patch for the issue.
