### Description

A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Calendar function of REDCap 13.1.9 allows authenticated users to execute arbitrary web script or HTML by injecting a crafted payload into the 'Notes' field of a calendar event. This could lead to the execution of malicious scripts when the event is viewed. Updating to version 14.2.1 or later is recommended to remediate this vulnerability.
