### Description

Deno is a runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript written in rust. Several cross-site scripting vulnerabilities existed in the `deno_doc` crate which lead to Self-XSS with deno doc --html. 1.) XSS in generated `search_index.js`, `deno_doc` outputs a JavaScript file for searching. However, the generated file used `innerHTML` on unsanitzed HTML input. 2.) XSS via property, method and enum names, `deno_doc` did not sanitize property names, method names and enum names. The first XSS most likely didn't have an impact since `deno doc --html` is expected to be used locally with own packages.
