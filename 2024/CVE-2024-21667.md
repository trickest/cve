### Description

pimcore/customer-data-framework is the Customer Management Framework for management of customer data within Pimcore. An authenticated and unauthorized user can access the GDPR data extraction feature and query over the information returned, leading to customer data exposure. Permissions are not enforced when reaching the `/admin/customermanagementframework/gdpr-data/search-data-objects` endpoint allowing an authenticated user without the permissions to access the endpoint and query the data available there. An unauthorized user can access PII data from customers. This vulnerability has been patched in version 4.0.6.
