### Description

The Affiliates Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 2.9.34. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the process_bulk_action function in ListAffiliatesTable.php. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete affiliates via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
