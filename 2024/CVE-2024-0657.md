### Description

The Internal Link Juicer: SEO Auto Linker for WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via admin settings such as 'ilj_settings_field_links_per_page'  in all versions up to, and including, 2.23.4 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level access, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.
