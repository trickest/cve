### Description

The SAP Fiori app (My Overtime Request) - version 605, does not perform the necessary authorization checks for an authenticated user which may result in an escalation of privileges. It is possible to manipulate the URLs of data requests to access information that the user should not have access to. There is no impact on integrity and availability.
