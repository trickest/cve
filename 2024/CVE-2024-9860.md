### Description

The Bridge Core plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data or loss of data due to a missing capability check on the 'import_action' and 'install_plugin_per_demo' functions in versions up to, and including, 3.3. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with subscriber-level permissions or above, to delete or change plugin settings, import demo data, and install limited plugins.
