### Description

A vulnerability in the file upload process of gradio-app/gradio version @gradio/video@0.10.2 allows for a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. An attacker can append a large number of characters to the end of a multipart boundary, causing the system to continuously process each character and issue warnings. This can render Gradio inaccessible for extended periods, disrupting services and causing significant downtime.
