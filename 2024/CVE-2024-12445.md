### Description

The RightMessage WP plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's 'rm_area' shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 0.9.7 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
