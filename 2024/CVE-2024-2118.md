### Description

The Social Media Share Buttons & Social Sharing Icons WordPress plugin before 2.8.9 does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)
