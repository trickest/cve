### Description

The Best WordPress Gallery Plugin – FooGallery plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the foogallery_attachment_modal_save action in all versions up to, and including, 2.4.14 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with author-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
