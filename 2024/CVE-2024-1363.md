### Description

The Easy Accordion – Best Accordion FAQ Plugin for WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the 'accordion_content_source' attribute in all versions up to, and including, 2.3.4 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
