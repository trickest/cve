### Description

An issue in Audimex EE versions 15.1.20 and earlier allowing a remote attacker to escalate privileges. Analyzing the offline client code, it was identified that it is possible for any user (with any privilege) of Audimex to dump the whole Audimex database. This gives visibility upon password hashes of any user, ongoing audit data and more.
