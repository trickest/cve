### Description

An issue was discovered in Italtel Embrace 1.6.4. The server does not properly handle application errors. In some cases, this leads to a disclosure of information about the server. An unauthenticated user is able craft specific requests in order to make the application generate an error. Inside an error message, some information about the server is revealed, such as the absolute path of the source code of the application. This kind of information can help an attacker to perform other attacks against the system. This can be exploited without authentication.
