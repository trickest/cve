### Description

The All-in-One Video Gallery plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the aiovg_create_attachment_from_external_image_url function in all versions up to, and including, 3.6.4. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.
