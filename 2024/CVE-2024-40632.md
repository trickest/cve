### Description

Linkerd is an open source, ultralight, security-first service mesh for Kubernetes. In affected versions when the application being run by linkerd is susceptible to SSRF, an attacker could potentially trigger a denial-of-service (DoS) attack by making requests to localhost:4191/shutdown. Linkerd could introduce an optional environment variable to control a token that must be passed as a header. Linkerd should reject shutdown requests that do not include this header. This issue has been addressed in release version edge-24.6.2 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
