### Description

Users who click on a malicious link or visit a website under the control of an attacker can be infected with arbitrary JavaScript which is running in the context of the "Numerix License Server Administration System Login" (nlslogin.jsp) page. The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request. The vendor was unresponsive during multiple attempts to contact them via various channels, hence there is no solution available. In case you are using this software, be sure to restrict access and monitor logs. Try to reach out to your contact person for this vendor and request a patch.
