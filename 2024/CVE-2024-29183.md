### Description

OpenRASP is a RASP solution that directly integrates its protection engine into the application server by instrumentation. There exists a reflected XSS in the /login page due to a reflection of the redirect parameter. This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary javascript with the permissions of a user after the user logins with their account.
