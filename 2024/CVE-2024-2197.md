### Description

The Chirp Access app contains a hard-coded password, BEACON_PASSWORD. An attacker within Bluetooth range could change configuration settings within the Bluetooth beacon, effectively disabling the application's ability to notify users when they are near a Beacon-enabled access point. This variable cannot be used to change the configuration settings of the door readers or locksets and does not affect the ability for authorized users of the mobile application to lock or unlock access points.
