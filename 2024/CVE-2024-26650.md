### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:platform/x86: p2sb: Allow p2sb_bar() calls during PCI device probep2sb_bar() unhides P2SB device to get resources from the device. Itguards the operation by locking pci_rescan_remove_lock so that parallelrescans do not find the P2SB device. However, this lock causes deadlockwhen PCI bus rescan is triggered by /sys/bus/pci/rescan. The rescanlocks pci_rescan_remove_lock and probes PCI devices. When PCI devicescall p2sb_bar() during probe, it locks pci_rescan_remove_lock again.Hence the deadlock.To avoid the deadlock, do not lock pci_rescan_remove_lock in p2sb_bar().Instead, do the lock at fs_initcall. Introduce p2sb_cache_resources()for fs_initcall which gets and caches the P2SB resources. At p2sb_bar(),refer the cache and return to the caller.Before operating the device at P2SB DEVFN for resource cache, checkthat its device class is PCI_CLASS_MEMORY_OTHER 0x0580 that PCHspecifications define. This avoids unexpected operation to other devicesat the same DEVFN.Tested-by Klara Modin <klarasmodin@gmail.com>
