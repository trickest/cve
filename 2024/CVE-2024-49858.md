### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:efistub/tpm: Use ACPI reclaim memory for event log to avoid corruptionThe TPM event log table is a Linux specific construct, where the dataproduced by the GetEventLog() boot service is cached in memory, andpassed on to the OS using an EFI configuration table.The use of EFI_LOADER_DATA here results in the region being leftunreserved in the E820 memory map constructed by the EFI stub, and thisis the memory description that is passed on to the incoming kernel bykexec, which is therefore unaware that the region should be reserved.Even though the utility of the TPM2 event log after a kexec isquestionable, any corruption might send the parsing code off into theweeds and crash the kernel. So let's use EFI_ACPI_RECLAIM_MEMORYinstead, which is always treated as reserved by the E820 conversionlogic.
