### Description

The Views for WPForms – Display & Edit WPForms Entries on your site frontend plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 3.2.2. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the 'create_view' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to create views via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
