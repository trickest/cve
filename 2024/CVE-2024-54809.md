### Description

Netgear Inc WNR854T 1.5.2 (North America) contains a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability in the parse_st_header function due to use of a request header parameter in a strncpy where size is determined based on the input specified. By sending a specially crafted packet, an attacker can take control of the program counter and hijack control flow of the program to execute arbitrary system commands.
