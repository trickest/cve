### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:Bluetooth: qca: fix NULL-deref on non-serdev suspendQualcomm ROME controllers can be registered from the Bluetooth linediscipline and in this case the HCI UART serdev pointer is NULL.Add the missing sanity check to prevent a NULL-pointer dereference whenwakeup() is called for a non-serdev controller during suspend.Just return true for now to restore the original behaviour and addressthe crash with pre-6.2 kernels, which do not have commit e9b3e5b8c657("Bluetooth: hci_qca: only assign wakeup with serial port support") thatcauses the crash to happen already at setup() time.
