### Description

LibreNMS is an open-source, PHP/MySQL/SNMP-based network monitoring system. A SQL injection vulnerability in POST /search/search=packages in LibreNMS prior to version 24.4.0 allows a user with global read privileges to execute SQL commands via the package parameter. With this vulnerability, an attacker can exploit a SQL injection time based vulnerability to extract all data from the database, such as administrator credentials. Version 24.4.0 contains a patch for the vulnerability.
