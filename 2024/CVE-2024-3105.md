### Description

The Woody code snippets – Insert Header Footer Code, AdSense Ads plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution in all versions up to, and including, 2.5.0 via the 'insert_php' shortcode. This is due to the plugin not restricting the usage of the functionality to high level authorized users. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to execute code on the server.
