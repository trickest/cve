### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:wifi: nl80211: fix bounds checker error in nl80211_parse_sched_scanThe channels array in the cfg80211_scan_request has a __counted_byattribute attached to it, which points to the n_channels variable. Thisattribute is used in bounds checking, and if it is not set before thearray is filled, then the bounds sanitizer will issue a warning or akernel panic if CONFIG_UBSAN_TRAP is set.This patch sets the size of allocated memory as the initial value forn_channels. It is updated with the actual number of added elements afterthe array is filled.
