### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:wifi: ath12k: fix crash when unbindingIf there is an error during some initialization related to firmware,the function ath12k_dp_cc_cleanup is called to release resources.However this is released again when the device is unbinded (ath12k_pci),and we get:BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000020at RIP: 0010:ath12k_dp_cc_cleanup.part.0+0xb6/0x500 [ath12k]Call Trace:ath12k_dp_cc_cleanupath12k_dp_freeath12k_core_deinitath12k_pci_remove...The issue is always reproducible from a VM because the MSI addressinginitialization is failing.In order to fix the issue, just set to NULL the released structure inath12k_dp_cc_cleanup at the end.
