### Description

A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Finesse could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct an SSRF attack on an affected system. This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input for specific HTTP requests that are sent to an affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to obtain limited sensitive information for services that are associated to the affected device.
