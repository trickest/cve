### Description

Piccolo Admin is an admin interface/content management system for Python, built on top of Piccolo. Piccolo's admin panel allows media files to be uploaded. As a default, SVG is an allowed file type for upload. An attacker can upload an SVG which when loaded can allow arbitrary access to the admin page. This vulnerability was patched in version 1.3.2.
