### Description

The WP Hotel Booking plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the update_review() function in all versions up to, and including, 2.1.2. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.
