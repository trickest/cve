### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:parport: Proper fix for array out-of-bounds accessThe recent fix for array out-of-bounds accesses replaced sprintf()calls blindly with snprintf().  However, since snprintf() returns thewould-be-printed size, not the actually output size, the lengthcalculation can still go over the given limit.Use scnprintf() instead of snprintf(), which returns the actuallyoutput letters, for addressing the potential out-of-bounds accessproperly.
