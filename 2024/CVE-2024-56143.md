### Description

Strapi is an open-source headless content management system. In versions from 5.0.0 to before 5.5.2, the lookup operator provided by the document service does not properly sanitize query parameters for private fields. An attacker can access private fields, including admin passwords and reset tokens, by crafting queries with the lookup parameter. This vulnerability is fixed in 5.5.2.
