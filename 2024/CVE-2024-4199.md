### Description

The Bulk Posts Editing For WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access of functionality due to a missing capability check on the plugin's AJAX actions in all versions up to, and including, 4.2.3. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber access and higher, to invoke their corresponding functions. This may lead to post creation and duplication, post content retrieval, post taxonomy manipulation.
