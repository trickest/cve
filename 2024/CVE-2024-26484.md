### Description

A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Edit Content Layout module of Kirby CMS v4.1.0 allows attackers to execute arbitrary web scripts or HTML via a crafted payload injected into the Link field. NOTE: the vendor's position is that this issue did not affect any version of Kirby CMS. The only effect was on the trykirby.com demo site, which is not customer-controlled.
