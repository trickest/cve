### Description

A vulnerability in the ISE Posture (System Scan) module of Cisco Secure Client for Linux could allow an authenticated, local attacker to elevate privileges on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to the use of an uncontrolled search path element. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by copying a malicious library file to a specific directory in the filesystem and persuading an administrator to restart a specific process. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on an affected device with root privileges.
