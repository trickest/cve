### Description

An issue was discovered in Ollama before 0.1.46. An attacker can use two HTTP requests to upload a malformed GGUF file containing just 4 bytes starting with the GGUF custom magic header. By leveraging a custom Modelfile that includes a FROM statement pointing to the attacker-controlled blob file, the attacker can crash the application through the CreateModel route, leading to a segmentation fault (signal SIGSEGV: segmentation violation).
