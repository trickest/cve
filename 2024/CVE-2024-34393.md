### Description

libxmljs2 is vulnerable to a type confusion vulnerability when parsing a specially crafted XML while invoking a function on the result of attrs() that was called on a parsed node. This vulnerability might lead to denial of service (on both 32-bit systems and 64-bit systems), data leak, infinite loop and remote code execution (on 32-bit systems with the XML_PARSE_HUGE flag enabled).
