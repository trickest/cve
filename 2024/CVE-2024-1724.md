### Description

In snapd versions prior to 2.62, when using AppArmor for enforcement of sandbox permissions, snapd failed to restrict writes to the $HOME/binpath. In Ubuntu, when this path exists, it is automatically added tothe users PATH. An attacker who could convince a user to install amalicious snap which used the 'home' plug could use this vulnerabilityto install arbitrary scripts into the users PATH which may then be runby the user outside of the expected snap sandbox and hence allow themto escape confinement.
