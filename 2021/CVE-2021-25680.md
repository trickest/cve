### Description

The AdTran Personal Phone Manager software is vulnerable to multiple reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) issues. These issues impact at minimum versions 10.8.1 and below but potentially impact later versions as well since they have not previously been disclosed. Only version 10.8.1 was able to be confirmed during primary research. NOTE: The affected appliances NetVanta 7060 and NetVanta 7100 are considered End of Life and as such this issue will not be patched
