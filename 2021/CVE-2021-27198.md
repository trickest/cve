### Description

An issue was discovered in Visualware MyConnection Server before v11.1a. Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution can occur via Arbitrary File Upload in the web service when using a myspeed/sf?filename= URI. This application is written in Java and is thus cross-platform. The Windows installation runs as SYSTEM, which means that exploitation gives one Administrator privileges on the target system.
