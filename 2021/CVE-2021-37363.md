### Description

An Insecure Permissions issue exists in Gestionale Open 11.00.00. A low privilege account is able to rename the mysqld.exe file located in bin folder and replace with a malicious file that would connect back to an attacking computer giving system level privileges (nt authority\system) due to the service running as Local System.
