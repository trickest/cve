### Description

The Support Board WordPress plugin before 3.3.4 does not escape multiple POST parameters (such as status_code, department, user_id, conversation_id, conversation_status_code, and recipient_id) before using them in SQL statements, leading to SQL injections which are exploitable by unauthenticated users.
