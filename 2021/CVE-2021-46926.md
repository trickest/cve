### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:ALSA: hda: intel-sdw-acpi: harden detection of controllerThe existing code currently sets a pointer to an ACPI handle beforechecking that it's actually a SoundWire controller. This can lead toissues where the graph walk continues and eventually fails, but thepointer was set already.This patch changes the logic so that the information provided tothe caller is set when a controller is found.
