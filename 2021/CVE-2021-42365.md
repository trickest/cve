### Description

The Asgaros Forums WordPress plugin is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting due to insufficient escaping via the name parameter found in the ~/admin/tables/admin-structure-table.php file which allowed attackers with administrative user access to inject arbitrary web scripts, in versions up to and including 1.15.13. This affects multi-site installations where unfiltered_html is disabled for administrators, and sites where unfiltered_html is disabled.
