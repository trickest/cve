### Description

The WPFront Notification Bar WordPress plugin before 2.0.0.07176 does not sanitise or escape its Custom CSS setting, allowing high privilege users such as admin to set XSS payload in it even when the unfiltered_html capability is disallowed, leading to an authenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting issue
