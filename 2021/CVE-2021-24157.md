### Description

Orbit Fox by ThemeIsle has a feature to add custom scripts to the header and footer of a page or post. There were no checks to verify that a user had the unfiltered_html capability prior to saving the script tags, thus allowing lower-level users to inject scripts that could potentially be malicious.
