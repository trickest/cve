### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:x86/kvm: Disable kvmclock on all CPUs on shutdownCurrenly, we disable kvmclock from machine_shutdown() hook and thisonly happens for boot CPU. We need to disable it for all CPUs toguard against memory corruption e.g. on restore from hibernate.Note, writing '0' to kvmclock MSR doesn't clear memory location, itjust prevents hypervisor from updating the location so for the shortwhile after write and while CPU is still alive, the clock remains usableand correct so we don't need to switch to some other clocksource.
