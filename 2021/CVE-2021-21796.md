### Description

An exploitable use-after-free vulnerability exists in the JavaScript implementation of Nitro Pro PDF. A specially crafted document can cause an object containing the path to a document to be destroyed and then later reused, resulting in a use-after-free vulnerability, which can lead to code execution under the context of the application. An attacker can convince a user to open a document to trigger this vulnerability.
