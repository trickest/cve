### Description

Null Pointer Dereference vulnerability in D-Link DIR-825 2.10b02, which could let a remote malicious user cause a denial of service. The vulnerability could be triggered by sending an HTTP request with URL /vct_wan; the sbin/httpd would invoke the strchr function and take NULL as a first argument, which finally leads to the segmentation fault. NOTE: The DIR-825 and all hardware revisions is considered End of Life and as such this issue will not be patched
