### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:mlxsw: spectrum: Protect driver from buggy firmwareWhen processing port up/down events generated by the device's firmware,the driver protects itself from events reported for non-existent localports, but not the CPU port (local port 0), which exists, but lacks anetdev.This can result in a NULL pointer dereference when callingnetif_carrier_{on,off}().Fix this by bailing early when processing an event reported for the CPUport. Problem was only observed when running on top of a buggy emulator.
