### Description

In all released versions of Eclipse Equinox, at least until version 4.21 (September 2021), installation can be vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attack if using p2 repos that are HTTP; that can then be exploited to serve incorrect p2 metadata and entirely alter the local installation, particularly by installing plug-ins that may then run malicious code.
