### Description

Unvalidated input and lack of output encoding in the Modern Events Calendar Lite WordPress plugin, versions before 5.16.5, did not sanitise the mic_comment field (Notes on time) when adding/editing an event, allowing users with privilege as low as author to add events with a Cross-Site Scripting payload in them, which will be triggered in the frontend when viewing the event.
