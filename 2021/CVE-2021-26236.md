### Description

FastStone Image Viewer v.<= 7.5 is affected by a Stack-based Buffer Overflow at 0x005BDF49, affecting the CUR file parsing functionality (BITMAPINFOHEADER Structure, 'BitCount' file format field), that will end up corrupting the Structure Exception Handler (SEH). Attackers could exploit this issue to achieve code execution when a user opens or views a malformed/specially crafted CUR file.
