### Description

NVIDIA vGPU software contains a vulnerability in the Virtual GPU Manager (vGPU plugin), where it doesn't release some resources during driver unload requests from guests. This flaw allows a malicious guest to perform operations by reusing those resources, which may lead to information disclosure, data tampering, or denial of service. This affects vGPU version 12.x (prior to 12.3), version 11.x (prior to 11.5) and version 8.x (prior 8.8).
