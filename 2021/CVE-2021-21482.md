### Description

SAP NetWeaver Master Data Management, versions - 710, 710.750, allows a malicious unauthorized user with access to the MDM Server subnet to find the password using a brute force method. If successful, the attacker could obtain access to highly sensitive data and MDM administrative privileges leading to information disclosure vulnerability thereby affecting the confidentiality and integrity of the application. This happens when security guidelines and recommendations concerning administrative accounts of an SAP NetWeaver Master Data Management installation have not been thoroughly reviewed.
