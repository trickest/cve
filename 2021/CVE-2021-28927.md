### Description

The text-to-speech engine in libretro RetroArch for Windows 1.9.0 passes unsanitized input to PowerShell through platform_win32.c via the accessibility_speak_windows function, which allows attackers who have write access on filesystems that are used by RetroArch to execute code via command injection using specially a crafted file and directory names.
