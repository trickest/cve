### Description

Pentaho Business Analytics Server versions before 9.2.0.2 and 8.3.0.25 using the Pentaho Analyzer plugin exposes a service endpoint for templates which allows a user-supplied path to access resources that are out of bounds. The software uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory, but the software does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname that can cause the pathname to resolve to a location that is outside of the restricted directory.  By using special elements such as ".." and "/" separators, attackers can escape outside of the restricted location to access files or directories that are elsewhere on the system.
