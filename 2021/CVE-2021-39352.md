### Description

The Catch Themes Demo Import WordPress plugin is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads via the import functionality found in the ~/inc/CatchThemesDemoImport.php file, in versions up to and including 1.7, due to insufficient file type validation. This makes it possible for an attacker with administrative privileges to upload malicious files that can be used to achieve remote code execution.
