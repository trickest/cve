### Description

Laravel Framework through 8.70.2 does not sufficiently block the upload of executable PHP content because Illuminate/Validation/Concerns/ValidatesAttributes.php lacks a check for .phar files, which are handled as application/x-httpd-php on systems based on Debian. NOTE: this CVE Record is for Laravel Framework, and is unrelated to any reports concerning incorrectly written user applications for image upload.
