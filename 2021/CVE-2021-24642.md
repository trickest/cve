### Description

The Scroll Baner WordPress plugin through 1.0 does not have CSRF check in place when saving its settings, nor perform any sanitisation, escaping or validation on them. This could allow attackers to make logged in admin change them and could lead to RCE (via a file upload) as well as XSS
