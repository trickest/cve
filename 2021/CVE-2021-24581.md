### Description

The Blue Admin WordPress plugin through 21.06.01 does not sanitise or escape its "Logo Title" setting before outputting in a page, leading to a Stored Cross-Site Scripting issue. Furthermore, the plugin does not have CSRF check in place when saving its settings, allowing the issue to be exploited via a CSRF attack.
