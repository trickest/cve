### Description

A vulnerability in the web UI of Gurock TestRail v5.3.0.3603 could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to affect the integrity of a device via a clickjacking attack. The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of iFrame data in HTTP requests that are sent to an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP packets with malicious iFrame data. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform a clickjacking attack where the user is tricked into clicking a malicious link.
