### Description

HyperKit is a toolkit for embedding hypervisor capabilities in an application. In versions 0.20210107 and prior, a malicious guest can trigger a vulnerability in the host by abusing the disk driver that may lead to the disclosure of the host memory into the virtualized guest. This issue is fixed in commit cf60095a4d8c3cb2e182a14415467afd356e982f.
