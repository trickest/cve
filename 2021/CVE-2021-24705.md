### Description

The NEX-Forms WordPress plugin before 8.4.3 does not have CSRF checks in place when editing a form, and does not escape some of its settings as well as form fields before outputting them in attributes. This could allow attackers to make a logged in admin edit arbitrary forms with Cross-Site Scripting payloads in them
