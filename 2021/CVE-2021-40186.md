### Description

The AppCheck research team identified a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability within the DNN CMS platform, formerly known as DotNetNuke. SSRF vulnerabilities allow the attacker to exploit the target system to make network requests on their behalf, allowing a range of possible attacks. In the most common scenario, the attacker exploits SSRF vulnerabilities to attack systems behind the firewall and access sensitive information from Cloud Provider metadata services.
