### Description

A vulnerability in Juniper Networks Junos OS allows an attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) to the device by sending certain crafted protocol packets from an adjacent device with invalid payloads to the device. These crafted packets, which should be discarded, are instead replicated and sent to the RE. Over time, a Denial of Service (DoS) occurs. Continued receipt of these crafted protocol packets will cause an extended Denial of Service (DoS) condition, which may cause wider traffic impact due to protocol flapping. An indication of compromise is to check "monitor interface traffic" on the ingress and egress port packet counts. For each ingress packet, two duplicate packets are seen on egress. This issue can be triggered by IPv4 and IPv6 packets. This issue affects all traffic through the device. This issue affects: Juniper Networks Junos OS: 14.1X53 versions prior to 14.1X53-D53 on EX4300, QFX3500, QFX5100, EX4600; 15.1 versions prior to 15.1R7-S6 on EX4300, QFX3500, QFX5100, EX4600; 16.1 versions prior to 16.1R7-S7 on EX4300, QFX5100, EX4600; 17.1 versions prior to 17.1R2-S11 on EX4300, QFX5100, EX4600; 17.1 versions prior to 117.1R3-S2 on EX4300; 17.2 versions prior to 17.2R1-S9 on EX4300; 17.2 versions prior to 17.2R3-S3 on EX4300, QFX5100, EX4600, QFX5110, QFX5200; 17.3 versions prior to 17.3R2-S5, 17.3R3-S7 on EX4300, QFX5100, EX4600, QFX5110, QFX5200; 17.4 versions prior to 17.4R2-S9, 17.4R3 on EX4300, QFX5100, EX4600, QFX5110, QFX5200; 18.1 versions prior to 18.1R3-S9 on EX4300, QFX5100, EX4600, QFX5110, QFX5200, QFX5210, EX2300, EX3400; 18.2 versions prior to 18.2R2-S7 on EX4300; 18.2 versions prior to 18.2R3-S3 on EX4300, QFX5100, EX4600, QFX5110, QFX5200, QFX5210, EX2300, EX3400; 18.3 versions prior to 18.3R2-S3, on EX4300; 18.3 versions prior to 18.3R1-S7, 18.3R3-S1 on EX4300, QFX5100, EX4600, QFX5110, QFX5200, QFX5210, QFX5120, EX4650, EX2300, EX3400; 18.4 versions prior to 18.4R1-S5, 18.4R2-S3, 18.4R3 on EX4300, QFX5100, EX4600, QFX5110, QFX5200, QFX5210, QFX5120, EX4650, EX2300, EX3400; 19.1 versions prior to 19.1R1-S4, 19.1R2-S1, 19.1R3 on EX4300, QFX5100, EX4600, QFX5110, QFX5200, QFX5210, QFX5120, EX4650, EX2300, EX3400; 19.2 versions prior to 19.2R1-S4, 19.2R2 on EX4300; 19.2 versions prior to 19.2R1-S3, 19.2R2 on QFX5100, EX4600, QFX5110, QFX5200, QFX5210, QFX5120, EX4650, EX2300, EX3400; 19.3 versions prior to 19.3R2-S1, 19.3R3 on EX4300; 19.3 versions prior to 19.3R1-S1, 19.3R2, 19.3R3 on QFX5100, EX4600, QFX5110, QFX5200, QFX5210, QFX5120, EX4650, EX2300, EX3400;
