### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:neighbour: allow NUD_NOARP entries to be forced GCedIFF_POINTOPOINT interfaces use NUD_NOARP entries for IPv6. It's possible tofill up the neighbour table with enough entries that it will overflow forvalid connections after that.This behaviour is more prevalent after commit 58956317c8de ("neighbor:Improve garbage collection") is applied, as it prevents removal fromentries that are not NUD_FAILED, unless they are more than 5s old.
