### Description

A vulnerability exists in XINJE XD/E Series PLC Program Tool in versions up to v3.5.1 that can allow an authenticated, local attacker to load a malicious DLL. Local access is required to successfully exploit this vulnerability. This means the potential attacker must have access to the system and sufficient file-write privileges. If exploited, the attacker could place a malicious DLL file on the system, that when running XINJE XD/E Series PLC Program Tool will allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of another user's account.
