### Description

The Five Star Restaurant Reservations WordPress plugin before 2.4.8 does not have capability and CSRF checks in the rtb_welcome_set_schedule AJAX action, allowing any authenticated users to call it. Due to the lack of sanitisation and escaping, users with a role as low as subscriber could perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks against logged in admins
