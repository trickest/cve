### Description

An issue was discovered in Digi TransPort DR64, SR44 VC74, and WR. The ZING protocol allows arbitrary remote command execution with SUPER privileges. This allows an attacker (with knowledge of the protocol) to execute arbitrary code on the controller including overwriting firmware, adding/removing users, disabling the internal firewall, etc.
