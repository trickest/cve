### Description

** UNSUPPORTED WHEN ASSIGNED ** Emerson Dixell XWEB-500 products are affected by arbitrary file write vulnerability in /cgi-bin/logo_extra_upload.cgi, /cgi-bin/cal_save.cgi, and /cgi-bin/lo_utils.cgi. An attacker will be able to write any file on the target system without any kind of authentication mechanism, and this can lead to denial of service and potentially remote code execution. Note: the product has not been supported since 2018 and should be removed or replaced.
