### Description

SuiteCRM before 7.11.19 allows remote code execution via the system settings Log File Name setting. In certain circumstances involving admin account takeover, logger_file_name can refer to an attacker-controlled PHP file under the web root, because only the all-lowercase PHP file extensions were blocked. NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2020-28328.
