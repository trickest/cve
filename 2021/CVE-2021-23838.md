### Description

An issue was discovered in flatCore before 2.0.0 build 139. A reflected XSS vulnerability was identified in the media_filter HTTP request body parameter for the acp interface. The affected parameter accepts malicious client-side script without proper input sanitization. For example, a malicious user can leverage this vulnerability to steal cookies from a victim user and perform a session-hijacking attack, which may then lead to unauthorized access to the site.
