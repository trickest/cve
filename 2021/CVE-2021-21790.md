### Description

An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the the way IOBit Advanced SystemCare Ultimate 14.2.0.220 driver handles Privileged I/O read requests. A specially crafted I/O request packet (IRP) can lead to privileged reads in the context of a driver which can result in sensitive information disclosure from the kernel. The IN instruction can read two bytes from the given I/O device, potentially leaking sensitive device data to unprivileged users.
