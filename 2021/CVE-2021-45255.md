### Description

The email parameter from ajax.php of Video Sharing Website 1.0 appears to be vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. A payload injects a SQL sub-query that calls MySQL's load_file function with a UNC file path that references a URL on an external domain. The application interacted with that domain, indicating that the injected SQL query was executed.
