### Description

webTareas version 2.4 and earlier allows an authenticated user to inject arbitrary web script or HTML due to incorrect sanitization of user-supplied data and achieve a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting attack against the platform users and administrators. The issue affects every endpoint on the application because it is related on how each URL is echoed back on every response page.
