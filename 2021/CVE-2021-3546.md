### Description

An out-of-bounds write vulnerability was found in the virtio vhost-user GPU device (vhost-user-gpu) of QEMU in versions up to and including 6.0. The flaw occurs while processing the 'VIRTIO_GPU_CMD_GET_CAPSET' command from the guest. It could allow a privileged guest user to crash the QEMU process on the host, resulting in a denial of service condition, or potential code execution with the privileges of the QEMU process.
