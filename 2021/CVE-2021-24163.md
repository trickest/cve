### Description

The AJAX action, wp_ajax_ninja_forms_sendwp_remote_install_handler, did not have a capability check on it, nor did it have any nonce protection, therefore making it possible for low-level users, such as subscribers, to install and activate the SendWP Ninja Forms Contact Form – The Drag and Drop Form Builder for WordPress WordPress plugin before 3.4.34 and retrieve the client_secret key needed to establish the SendWP connection while also installing the SendWP plugin.
