### Description

Qihoo 360 (https://www.360.cn/) Qihoo 360 Safeguard (https://www.360.cn/) Qihoo 360 Total Security (http://www.360totalsecurity.com/) is affected by: Buffer Overflow. The impact is: execute arbitrary code (local). The component is: This is a set of vulnerabilities affecting popular software, "360 Safeguard(12.1.0.1004,12.1.0.1005,13.1.0.1001)" , "360 Total Security(10.8.0.1060,10.8.0.1213)", "360 Safe Browser & 360 Chrome(13.0.2170.0)".
