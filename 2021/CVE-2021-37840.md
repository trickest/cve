### Description

aaPanel through 6.8.12 allows Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking (CSWH) involving OS commands within WebSocket messages at a ws:// URL for /webssh (the victim must have configured Terminal with at least one host). Successful exploitation depends on the browser used by a potential victim (e.g., exploitation can occur with Firefox but not Chrome).
