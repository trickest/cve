### Description

The Shortcodes Ultimate WordPress plugin before 5.10.2 allows users with Contributor roles to perform stored XSS via shortcode attributes. Note: the plugin is inconsistent in its handling of shortcode attributes; some do escape, most don't, and there are even some attributes that are insecure by design (like [su_button]'s onclick attribute).
