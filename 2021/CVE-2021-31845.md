### Description

A buffer overflow vulnerability in McAfee Data Loss Prevention (DLP) Discover prior to 11.6.100 allows an attacker in the same network as the DLP Discover to execute arbitrary code through placing carefully constructed Ami Pro (.sam) files onto a machine and having DLP Discover scan it, leading to remote code execution with elevated privileges. This is caused by the destination buffer being of fixed size and incorrect checks being made on the source size.
