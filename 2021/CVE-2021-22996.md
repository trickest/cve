### Description

On all 7.x versions (fixed in 8.0.0), when set up for auto failover, a BIG-IQ Data Collection Device (DCD) cluster member that receives an undisclosed message may cause the corosync process to abort. This behavior may lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) and impact the stability of a BIG-IQ high availability (HA) cluster. Note: Software versions which have reached End of Software Development (EoSD) are not evaluated.
