### Description

An issue was discovered in Reprise RLM 14.2. When editing the license file, it is possible for an admin user to enable an option to run arbitrary executables, as demonstrated by an ISV demo "C:\Windows\System32\calc.exe" entry. An attacker can exploit this to run a malicious binary on startup, or when triggering the Reread/Restart Servers function on the webserver. (Exploitation does not require CVE-2018-15573, because the license file is meant to be changed in the application.)
