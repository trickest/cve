### Description

The npm hbs package is an Express view engine wrapper for Handlebars. Depending on usage, users of hbs may be vulnerable to a file disclosure vulnerability. There is currently no patch for this vulnerability. hbs mixes pure template data with engine configuration options through the Express render API. By overwriting internal configuration options a file disclosure vulnerability may be triggered in downstream applications. For an example PoC see the referenced GHSL-2021-020.
