### Description

The options.php file of the WP-Board WordPress plugin through 1.1 beta accepts a postid parameter which is not sanitised, escaped or validated before inserting to a SQL statement, leading to SQL injection. This is a time based SQLI and in the same function vulnerable parameter is passed twice so if we pass time as 5 seconds it takes 10 seconds to return since the query ran twice.
