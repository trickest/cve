### Description

Eclipse Jersey 2.28 to 2.33 and Eclipse Jersey 3.0.0 to 3.0.1 contains a local information disclosure vulnerability. This is due to the use of the File.createTempFile which creates a file inside of the system temporary directory with the permissions: -rw-r--r--. Thus the contents of this file are viewable by all other users locally on the system. As such, if the contents written is security sensitive, it can be disclosed to other local users.
