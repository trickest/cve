The OSMapper WordPress plugin through 2.1.5 contains an AJAX action to delete a plugin related post type named 'map' and is registered with the wp_ajax_nopriv prefix, making it available to unauthenticated users. There is no authorisation, CSRF and checks in place to ensure that the post to delete is a map one. As a result, unauthenticated user can delete arbitrary posts from the blog
