### Description

Clementine Music Player through 1.3.1 (when a GLib 2.0.0 DLL is used) is vulnerable to a Read Access Violation on Block Data Move, affecting the MP3 file parsing functionality at memcpy+0x265. The vulnerability is triggered when the user opens a crafted MP3 file or loads a remote stream URL that is mishandled by Clementine. Attackers could exploit this issue to cause a crash (DoS) of the clementine.exe process or achieve arbitrary code execution in the context of the current logged-in Windows user.
