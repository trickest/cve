### Description

A CSV injection vulnerability on the login panel of ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus Version: 6.1 Build No: 6101 can be exploited by an unauthenticated user. The j_username parameter seems to be vulnerable and a reverse shell could be obtained if a privileged user exports "User Attempts Audit Report" as CSV file. Note: The vendor disputes this vulnerability, claiming "This is not a valid vulnerability in our ADSSP product. We don't see this as a security issue at our side.
