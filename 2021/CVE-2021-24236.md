### Description

The Imagements WordPress plugin through 1.2.5 allows images to be uploaded in comments, however only checks for the Content-Type in the request to forbid dangerous files. This allows unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files by using a valid image Content-Type along with a PHP filename and code, leading to RCE.
