### Description

Directus 8 before 8.8.2 allows remote authenticated users to execute arbitrary code because file-upload permissions include the ability to upload a .php file to the main upload directory and/or upload a .php file and a .htaccess file to a subdirectory. Exploitation succeeds only for certain installations with the Apache HTTP Server and the local-storage driver (e.g., when the product was obtained from hub.docker.com).
