### Description

EVOLUCARE ECSIMAGING (aka ECS Imaging) through 6.21.5 has multiple SQL Injection issues in the login form and the password-forgotten form (such as /req_password_user.php?email=). This allows an attacker to steal data in the database and obtain access to the application. (The database component runs as root.) NOTE: This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer
