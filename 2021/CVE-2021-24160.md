### Description

In the Reponsive Menu (free and Pro) WordPress plugins before 4.0.4, subscribers could upload zip archives containing malicious PHP files that would get extracted to the /rmp-menu/ directory. These files could then be accessed via the front end of the site to trigger remote code execution and ultimately allow an attacker to execute commands to further infect a WordPress site.
