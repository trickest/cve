### Description

The SupportCandy WordPress plugin before 2.2.5 does not have authorisation and CSRF checks in its wpsc_tickets AJAX action, which could allow unauthenticated users to call it and delete arbitrary tickets via the set_delete_permanently_bulk_ticket setting_action. Other actions may be affected as well.
