### Description

webTareas version 2.4 and earlier allows an authenticated user to arbitrarily upload potentially dangerous files without restrictions. This is working by adding or replacing a personal profile picture. The affected endpoint is /includes/upload.php on the HTTP POST data. This allows an attacker to exploit the platform by injecting code or malware and, under certain conditions, to execute code on remote user browsers.
