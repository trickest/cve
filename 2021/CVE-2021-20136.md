### Description

ManageEngine Log360 Builds < 5235 are affected by an improper access control vulnerability allowing database configuration overwrite. An unauthenticated remote attacker can send a specially crafted message to Log360 to change its backend database to an attacker-controlled database and to force Log360 to restart. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to achieve remote code execution by replacing files executed by Log360 on startup.
