### Description

Revive Adserver before 5.1.0 is vulnerable to a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability via the publicly accessible afr.php delivery script. While this issue was previously addressed in modern browsers as CVE-2020-8115, some older browsers (e.g., IE10) that do not automatically URL encode parameters were still vulnerable.
