### Description

The restricted shell provided by Akkadian Provisioning Manager Engine (PME) can be escaped by abusing the 'Edit MySQL Configuration' command. This command launches a standard vi editor interface which can then be escaped. This issue was resolved in Akkadian OVA appliance version 3.0 (and later), Akkadian Provisioning Manager 5.0.2 (and later), and Akkadian Appliance Manager 3.3.0.314-4a349e0 (and later).
