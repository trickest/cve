### Description

An out-of-bounds access flaw was found in the Linux kernel's implementation of the eBPF code verifier in the way a user running the eBPF script calls dev_map_init_map or sock_map_alloc. This flaw allows a local user to crash the system or possibly escalate their privileges. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability.
