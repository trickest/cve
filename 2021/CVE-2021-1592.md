### Description

A vulnerability in the way Cisco UCS Manager software handles SSH sessions could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to improper resource management for established SSH sessions. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by opening a significant number of SSH sessions on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a crash and restart of internal Cisco UCS Manager software processes and a temporary loss of access to the Cisco UCS Manager CLI and web UI. Note: The attacker must have valid user credentials to authenticate to the affected device.
