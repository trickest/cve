### Description

Multiple Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issues were discovered in OpenEMR 5.0.0 and 5.0.1-dev. The vulnerabilities exist due to insufficient filtration of user-supplied data passed to the "openemr-master/gacl/admin/object_search.php" URL (section_value; src_form). An attacker could execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a browser in the context of the vulnerable website.
