### Description

The JMX server embedded in Apache James, also used by the command line client is exposed to a java de-serialization issue, and thus can be used to execute arbitrary commands. As James exposes JMX socket by default only on local-host, this vulnerability can only be used for privilege escalation. Release 3.0.1 upgrades the incriminated library.
