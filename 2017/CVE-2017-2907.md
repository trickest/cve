### Description

An exploitable integer overflow exists in the animation playing functionality of the Blender open-source 3d creation suite version 2.78c. A specially created '.avi' file can cause an integer overflow resulting in a buffer overflow which can allow for code execution under the context of the application. An attacker can convince a user to use the file as an asset in order to trigger this vulnerability.
