### Description

An issue was discovered on Accellion FTA devices before FTA_9_12_180. There is XSS in courier/1000@/index.html with the auth_params parameter. The device tries to use internal WAF filters to stop specific XSS Vulnerabilities. However, these can be bypassed by using some modifications to the payloads, e.g., URL encoding.
