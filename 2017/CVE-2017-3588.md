### Description

Vulnerability in the Solaris Cluster component of Oracle Sun Systems Products Suite (subcomponent: HA for MySQL). Supported versions that are affected are 3.3 and 4.3. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with logon to the infrastructure where Solaris Cluster executes to compromise Solaris Cluster. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized creation, deletion or modification access to critical data or all Solaris Cluster accessible data as well as unauthorized access to critical data or complete access to all Solaris Cluster accessible data and unauthorized ability to cause a partial denial of service (partial DOS) of Solaris Cluster. CVSS 3.0 Base Score 7.3 (Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability impacts). CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L).
