### Description

Inteno iopsys 2.0-3.14 and 4.0 devices allow remote authenticated users to execute arbitrary OS commands by modifying the leasetrigger field in the odhcpd configuration to specify an arbitrary program, as demonstrated by a program located on an SMB share. This issue existed because the /etc/uci-defaults directory was not being used to secure the OpenWrt configuration.
