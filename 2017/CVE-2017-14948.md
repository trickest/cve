### Description

Certain D-Link products are affected by: Buffer Overflow. This affects DIR-880L 1.08B04 and DIR-895 L/R 1.13b03. The impact is: execute arbitrary code (remote). The component is: htdocs/fileaccess.cgi. The attack vector is: A crafted HTTP request handled by fileacces.cgi could allow an attacker to mount a ROP attack: if the HTTP header field CONTENT_TYPE starts with ''boundary=' followed by more than 256 characters, a buffer overflow would be triggered, potentially causing code execution.
