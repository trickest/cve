### Description

An issue was discovered in the size of the default stack guard page on PAX Linux (originally from GRSecurity but shipped by other Linux vendors), specifically the default stack guard page is not sufficiently large and can be "jumped" over (the stack guard page is bypassed), this affects PAX Linux Kernel versions as of June 19, 2017 (specific version information is not available at this time).
