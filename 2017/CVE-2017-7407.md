### Description

The ourWriteOut function in tool_writeout.c in curl 7.53.1 might allow physically proximate attackers to obtain sensitive information from process memory in opportunistic circumstances by reading a workstation screen during use of a --write-out argument ending in a '%' character, which leads to a heap-based buffer over-read.
