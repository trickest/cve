### Description

The Epson "EasyMP" software is designed to remotely stream a users computer to supporting projectors.These devices are authenticated using a unique 4-digit code, displayed on-screen - ensuring only those who can view it are streaming.In addition to the password, each projector has a hardcoded "backdoor" code (2270), which authenticates to all devices.
