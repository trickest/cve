### Description

The Humax Wi-Fi Router model HG100R-* 2.0.6 is prone to an authentication bypass vulnerability via specially crafted requests to the management console. The bug is exploitable remotely when the router is configured to expose the management console. The router is not validating the session token while returning answers for some methods in url '/api'. An attacker can use this vulnerability to retrieve sensitive information such as private/public IP addresses, SSID names, and passwords.
