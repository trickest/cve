### Description

In Apache Geode before v1.4.0, the Geode server stores application objects in serialized form. Certain cluster operations and API invocations cause these objects to be deserialized. A user with DATA:WRITE access to the cluster may be able to cause remote code execution if certain classes are present on the classpath.
