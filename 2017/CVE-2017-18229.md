### Description

An issue was discovered in GraphicsMagick 1.3.26. An allocation failure vulnerability was found in the function ReadTIFFImage in coders/tiff.c, which allows attackers to cause a denial of service via a crafted file, because file size is not properly used to restrict scanline, strip, and tile allocations.
