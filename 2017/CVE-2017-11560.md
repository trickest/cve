### Description

An issue was discovered in ZOHO ManageEngine OpManager 12.2. By adding a Google Map to the application, an authenticated user can upload an HTML file. This HTML file is then rendered in various locations of the application. JavaScript inside the uploaded HTML is also interpreted by the application. Thus, an attacker can inject a malicious JavaScript payload inside the HTML file and upload it to the application.
