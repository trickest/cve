### Description

Several rest inline action resources of Atlassian Activity Streams before version 6.3.0 allows remote authenticated attackers to watch any Confluence page & receive notifications when comments are added to the watched page, and vote & watch JIRA issues that they do not have access to, although they will not receive notifications for the issue, via missing permission checks.
