### Description

An issue was discovered in icoutils 0.31.1. A buffer overflow was observed in the "decode_ne_resource_id" function in the "restable.c" source file. This is happening because the "len" parameter for memcpy is not checked for size and thus becomes a negative integer in the process, resulting in a failed memcpy. This affects wrestool.
