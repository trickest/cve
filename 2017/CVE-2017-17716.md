### Description

GitLab 9.4.x before 9.4.2 does not support LDAP SSL certificate verification, but a verify_certificates LDAP option was mentioned in the 9.4 release announcement. This issue occurred because code was not merged. This is related to use of the omniauth-ldap library and the gitlab_omniauth-ldap gem.
