### Description

The Billion 5200W-T TCLinux Fw $7.3.8.0 v008 130603 router distributed by TrueOnline has three user accounts with default passwords, including two hardcoded service accounts: one with the username true and password true, and another with the username user3 and and a long password consisting of a repetition of the string 0123456789. These accounts can be used to login to the web interface, exploit authenticated command injections, and change router settings for malicious purposes.
