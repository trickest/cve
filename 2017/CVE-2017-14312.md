### Description

Nagios Core through 4.3.4 initially executes /usr/sbin/nagios as root but supports configuration options in which this file is owned by a non-root account (and similarly can have nagios.cfg owned by a non-root account), which allows local users to gain privileges by leveraging access to this non-root account.
