### Description

Multiple buffer overflow vulnerabilities exist in the HTTPd server in Asus asuswrt version <=3.0.0.4.376.X. All have been fixed in version 3.0.0.4.378, but this vulnerability was not previously disclosed. Some end-of-life routers have this version as the newest and thus are vulnerable at this time. This vulnerability allows for RCE with administrator rights when the administrator visits several pages.
