### Description

On the OSNEXUS QuantaStor v4 virtual appliance before 4.3.1, if the REST call invoked does not exist, an error will be triggered containing the invalid method previously invoked. The response sent to the user isn't sanitized in this case. An attacker can leverage this issue by including arbitrary HTML or JavaScript code as a parameter, aka XSS.
