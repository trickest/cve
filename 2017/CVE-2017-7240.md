### Description

An issue was discovered on Miele Professional PST10 devices. The corresponding embedded webserver "PST10 WebServer" typically listens to port 80 and is prone to a directory traversal attack; therefore, an unauthenticated attacker may be able to exploit this issue to access sensitive information to aide in subsequent attacks. A Proof of Concept is GET /../../../../../../../../../../../../etc/shadow HTTP/1.1. This affects PG8527 devices 2.02 before 2.12, PG8527 devices 2.51 before 2.61, PG8527 devices 2.52 before 2.62, PG8527 devices 2.54 before 2.64, PG8528 devices 2.02 before 2.12, PG8528 devices 2.51 before 2.61, PG8528 devices 2.52 before 2.62, PG8528 devices 2.54 before 2.64, PG8535 devices 1.00 before 1.10, PG8535 devices 1.04 before 1.14, PG8536 devices 1.10 before 1.20, and PG8536 devices 1.14 before 1.24.
