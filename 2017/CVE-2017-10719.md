### Description

Recently it was discovered as a part of the research on IoT devices in the most recent firmware for Shekar Endoscope that the device has default Wi-Fi credentials that are exactly the same for every device. This device acts as an Endoscope camera that allows its users to use it in various industrial systems and settings, car garages, and also in some cases in the medical clinics to get access to areas that are difficult for a human being to reach. Any breach of this system can allow an attacker to get access to video feed and pictures viewed by that user and might allow them to get a foot hold in air gapped networks especially in case of nation critical infrastructure/industries.
