### Description

dwarf1.c in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library (aka libbfd), as distributed in GNU Binutils 2.29, mishandles pointers, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted ELF file, related to parse_die and parse_line_table, as demonstrated by a parse_die heap-based buffer over-read.
