### Description

It was discovered as a part of the research on IoT devices in the most recent firmware for Blipcare device that the device allows to connect to web management interface on a non-SSL connection using plain text HTTP protocol. The user uses the web management interface of the device to provide the user's Wi-Fi credentials so that the device can connect to it and have Internet access. This device acts as a Wireless Blood pressure monitor and is used to measure blood pressure levels of a person. This allows an attacker who is connected to the Blipcare's device wireless network to easily sniff these values using a MITM attack.
