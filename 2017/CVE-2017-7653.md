### Description

The Eclipse Mosquitto broker up to version 1.4.15 does not reject strings that are not valid UTF-8. A malicious client could cause other clients that do reject invalid UTF-8 strings to disconnect themselves from the broker by sending a topic string which is not valid UTF-8, and so cause a denial of service for the clients.
