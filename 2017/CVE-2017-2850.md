### Description

In the web management interface in Foscam C1 Indoor HD cameras with application firmware 2.52.2.37, a specially crafted HTTP request can allow for a user to inject arbitrary characters in the pureftpd.passwd file during a username change, which in turn allows for bypassing chroot restrictions in the FTP server. An attacker can simply send an HTTP request to the device to trigger this vulnerability.
