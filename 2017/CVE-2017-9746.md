### Description

The disassemble_bytes function in objdump.c in GNU Binutils 2.28 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (buffer overflow and application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted binary file, as demonstrated by mishandling of rae insns printing for this file during "objdump -D" execution.
