### Description

Multiple Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issues were discovered in ATutor 2.2.2. The vulnerabilities exist due to insufficient filtration of user-supplied data passed to several pages (lang_code in themes/*/admin/system_preferences/language_edit.tmpl.php). An attacker could execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a browser in the context of the vulnerable website.
