### Description

An issue was discovered on D-Link DCS-1100 and DCS-1130 devices. The device has a custom binary called mp4ts under the /var/www/video folder. It seems that this binary dumps the HTTP VERB in the system logs. As a part of doing that it retrieves the HTTP VERB sent by the user and uses a vulnerable sprintf function at address 0x0000C3D4 in the function sub_C210 to copy the value into a string and then into a log file. Since there is no bounds check being performed on the environment variable at address 0x0000C360 this results in a stack overflow and overwrites the PC register allowing an attacker to execute buffer overflow or even a command injection attack.
