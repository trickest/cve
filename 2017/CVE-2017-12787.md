### Description

A network interface of the novi_process_manager_daemon service, included in the NoviWare software distribution through NW400.2.6 and deployed on NoviSwitch devices, can be inadvertently exposed if an operator attempts to modify ACLs, because of a bug when ACL modifications are applied. This could be leveraged by remote, unauthenticated attackers to gain resultant privileged (root) code execution on the switch, because incoming packet data can contain embedded OS commands, and can also trigger a stack-based buffer overflow.
