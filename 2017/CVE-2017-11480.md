### Description

Packetbeat versions prior to 5.6.4 are affected by a denial of service flaw in the PostgreSQL protocol handler. If Packetbeat is listening for PostgreSQL traffic and a user is able to send arbitrary network traffic to the monitored port, the attacker could prevent Packetbeat from properly logging other PostgreSQL traffic.
