### Description

An issue was discovered in OnePlus One, X, 2, 3, 3T, and 5 devices with OxygenOS 5.0 and earlier. The attacker can reboot the device into the Qualcomm Emergency Download (EDL) mode through ADB or by using Volume-Up when connected to USB, which in turn could allow for downgrading partitions such as the Android Bootloader.
