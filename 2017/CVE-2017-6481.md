### Description

Multiple Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issues were discovered in phpipam 1.2. The vulnerabilities exist due to insufficient filtration of user-supplied data passed to several pages (instructions in app/admin/instructions/preview.php; subnetId in app/admin/powerDNS/refresh-ptr-records.php). An attacker could execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a browser in the context of the vulnerable website.
