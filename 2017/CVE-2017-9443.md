### Description

** DISPUTED ** BigTree CMS through 4.2.18 allows remote authenticated users to conduct SQL injection attacks via a crafted tables object in manifest.json in an uploaded package. This issue exists in core\admin\modules\developer\extensions\install\process.php and core\admin\modules\developer\packages\install\process.php. NOTE: the vendor states "You must implicitly trust any package or extension you install as they all have the ability to write PHP files."
