### Description

In the ServiceManager::add function in the hardware service manager, there is an insecure permissions check based on the PID of the caller which could allow an application or service to replace a HAL service with its own service. This could lead to a local elevation of privilege enabling code execution as a privileged process with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation. Product: Android. Versions: 8.0, 8.1. Android ID: A-68217907.
