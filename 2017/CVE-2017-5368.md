### Description

ZoneMinder v1.30 and v1.29, an open-source CCTV server web application, is vulnerable to CSRF (Cross Site Request Forgery) which allows a remote attack to make changes to the web application as the current logged in victim. If the victim visits a malicious web page, the attacker can silently and automatically create a new admin user within the web application for remote persistence and further attacks. The URL is /zm/index.php and sample parameters could include action=user uid=0 newUser[Username]=attacker1 newUser[Password]=Password1234 conf_password=Password1234 newUser[System]=Edit (among others).
