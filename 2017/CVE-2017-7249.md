### Description

Multiple Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) were discovered in Gazelle before 2017-03-19. The vulnerabilities exist due to insufficient filtration of user-supplied data (action, userid) passed to the 'Gazelle-master/sections/tools/data/ocelot_info.php' URL. An attacker could execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a browser in the context of the vulnerable website.
