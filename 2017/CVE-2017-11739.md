### Description

In Zoho ManageEngine Application Manager 13.1 Build 13100, an authenticated user, with administrative privileges, has the ability to add a widget on any dashboard. This widget can be a "Utility Widget" with a "Custom HTML or Text" field. Once this widget is created, it will be loaded on the dashboard where it was added. An attacker can abuse this functionality by creating a "Utility Widget" that contains malicious JavaScript code, aka XSS.
