### Description

A Stack-based Buffer Overflow issue was discovered in Advantech WebAccess versions prior to V8.2_20170817. The application lacks proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a stack-based buffer, which could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code under the context of the process.
