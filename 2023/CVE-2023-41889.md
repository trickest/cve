### Description

SHIRASAGI is a Content Management System. Prior to version 1.18.0, SHIRASAGI is vulnerable to a Post-Unicode normalization issue. This happens when a logical validation or a security check is performed before a Unicode normalization. The Unicode character equivalent of a character would resurface after the normalization. The fix is initially performing the Unicode normalization and then strip for all whitespaces and then checking for a blank string. This issue has been fixed in version 1.18.0.
