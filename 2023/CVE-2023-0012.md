### Description

In SAP Host Agent (Windows) - versions 7.21, 7.22, an attacker who gains local membership to SAP_LocalAdmin could be able to replace executables with a malicious file that will be started under a privileged account. Note that by default all user members of SAP_LocaAdmin are denied the ability to logon locally by security policy so that this can only occur if the system has already been compromised.
