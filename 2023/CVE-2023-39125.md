### Description

NTSC-CRT 2.2.1 has an integer overflow and out-of-bounds write in loadBMP in bmp_rw.c because a file's width, height, and BPP are not validated. NOTE: the vendor's perspective is "this main application was not intended to be a well tested program, it's just something to demonstrate it works and for the user to see how to integrate it into their own programs."
