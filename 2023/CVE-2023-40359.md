### Description

xterm before 380 supports ReGIS reporting for character-set names even if they have unexpected characters (i.e., neither alphanumeric nor underscore), aka a pointer/overflow issue. This can only occur for xterm installations that are configured at compile time to use a certain experimental feature.
