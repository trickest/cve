### Description

The BookingPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to insufficient file validation on the 'bookingpress_process_upload' function in versions up to, and including, 1.0.76. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with administrator-level capabilities or above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.
