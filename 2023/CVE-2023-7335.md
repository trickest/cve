### Description

EduSoho versions prior to 22.4.7 contain an arbitrary file read vulnerability in the classroom-course-statistics export functionality. A remote, unauthenticated attacker can supply crafted path traversal sequences in the fileNames[] parameter to read arbitrary files from the server filesystem, including application configuration files such as config/parameters.yml that may contain secrets and database credentials. Exploitation evidence was observed by the Shadowserver Foundation on 2026-01-19 (UTC).
