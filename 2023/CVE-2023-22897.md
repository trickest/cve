### Description

An issue was discovered in SecurePoint UTM before 12.2.5.1. The firewall's endpoint at /spcgi.cgi allows information disclosure of memory contents to be achieved by an authenticated user. Essentially, uninitialized data can be retrieved via an approach in which a sessionid is obtained but not used.
