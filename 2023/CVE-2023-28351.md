### Description

An issue was discovered in Faronics Insight 10.0.19045 on Windows. Every keystroke made by any user on a computer with the Student application installed is logged to a world-readable directory. A local attacker can trivially extract these cleartext keystrokes, potentially enabling them to obtain PII and/or to compromise personal accounts owned by the victim.
