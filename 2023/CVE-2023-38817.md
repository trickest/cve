### Description

An issue in Inspect Element Ltd Echo.ac v.5.2.1.0 allows a local attacker to gain privileges via a crafted command to the echo_driver.sys component. NOTE: the vendor's position is that the reported ability for user-mode applications to execute code as NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM was "deactivated by Microsoft itself."
