### Description

A vulnerability in the management CLI of Cisco access point (AP) software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of commands supplied by the user. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to a device and submitting crafted input to the affected command. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause an affected device to reload spontaneously, resulting in a DoS condition.
