### Description

A flaw was found in the networking subsystem of the Linux kernel within the handling of the RPL protocol. This issue results from the lack of proper handling of user-supplied data, which can lead to an assertion failure. This may allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to create a denial of service condition on the system.
