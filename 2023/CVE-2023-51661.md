### Description

Wasmer is a WebAssembly runtime that enables containers to run anywhere: from Desktop to the Cloud, Edge and even the browser. Wasm programs can access the filesystem outside of the sandbox. Service providers running untrusted Wasm code on Wasmer can unexpectedly expose the host filesystem. This vulnerability has been patched in version 4.2.4.
