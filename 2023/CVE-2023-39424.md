### Description

A vulnerability in RDPngFileUpload.dll, as used in the IRM Next Generation booking system, allows a remote attacker to upload arbitrary content (such as a web shell component) to the SQL database and execute it with SYSTEM privileges. This vulnerability requires authentication to be exploited but can be paired with another vulnerability in the platform (CVE-2023-39420, which grants access to hardcoded credentials) to carry the attack without having assigned credentials.
