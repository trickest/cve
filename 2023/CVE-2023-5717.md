### Description

A heap out-of-bounds write vulnerability in the Linux kernel's Linux Kernel Performance Events (perf) component can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation.If perf_read_group() is called while an event's sibling_list is smaller than its child's sibling_list, it can increment or write to memory locations outside of the allocated buffer.We recommend upgrading past commit 32671e3799ca2e4590773fd0e63aaa4229e50c06.
