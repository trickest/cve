### Description

The WPCS – WordPress Currency Switcher Professional plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's wpcs_current_currency shortcode in versions up to, and including, 1.1.9 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
