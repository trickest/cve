### Description

Issue summary: Checking excessively long DH keys or parameters may be very slow.Impact summary: Applications that use the functions DH_check(), DH_check_ex()or EVP_PKEY_param_check() to check a DH key or DH parameters may experience longdelays. Where the key or parameters that are being checked have been obtainedfrom an untrusted source this may lead to a Denial of Service.The function DH_check() performs various checks on DH parameters. After fixingCVE-2023-3446 it was discovered that a large q parameter value can also triggeran overly long computation during some of these checks. A correct q value,if present, cannot be larger than the modulus p parameter, thus it isunnecessary to perform these checks if q is larger than p.An application that calls DH_check() and supplies a key or parameters obtainedfrom an untrusted source could be vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack.The function DH_check() is itself called by a number of other OpenSSL functions.An application calling any of those other functions may similarly be affected.The other functions affected by this are DH_check_ex() andEVP_PKEY_param_check().Also vulnerable are the OpenSSL dhparam and pkeyparam command line applicationswhen using the "-check" option.The OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue.The OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are not affected by this issue.
