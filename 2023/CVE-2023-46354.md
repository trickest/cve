### Description

In the module "Orders (CSV, Excel) Export PRO" (ordersexport) < 5.2.0 from MyPrestaModules for PrestaShop, a guest can download personal information without restriction. Due to a lack of permissions control, a guest can access exports from the module which can lead to a leak of personal information from ps_customer/ps_address tables such as name / surname / email / phone number / full postal address.
