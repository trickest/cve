### Description

The Print Invoice & Delivery Notes for WooCommerce WordPress plugin before 4.7.2 is vulnerable to reflected XSS by echoing a GET value in an admin note within the WooCommerce orders page. This means that this vulnerability can be exploited for users with the edit_others_shop_orders capability. WooCommerce must be installed and active. This vulnerability is caused by a urldecode() after cleanup with esc_url_raw(), allowing double encoding.
