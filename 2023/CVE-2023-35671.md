### Description

In onHostEmulationData of HostEmulationManager.java, there is a possible way for a general purpose NFC reader to read the full card number and expiry details when the device is in locked screen mode due to a logic error in the code. This could lead to local information disclosure with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.
