### Description

An insertion of sensitive information into the log file in the audit log in GitHub Enterprise Server was identified that could allow an attacker to gain access to the management console. To exploit this, an attacker would need access to the log files for the GitHub Enterprise Server appliance, a backup archive created with GitHub Enterprise Server Backup Utilities, or a service which received streamed logs. This vulnerability affected all versions of GitHub Enterprise Server since 3.8 and was fixed in version 3.8.12, 3.9.7, 3.10.4, and 3.11.1.
