Versions of the package quill-mention before 4.0.0 are vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) due to improper user-input sanitization, via the renderList function. **Note:**If the mentions list is sourced from unsafe (user-sourced) data, this might allow an injection attack when a Quill user hits @.
