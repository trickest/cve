### Description

An excessively large PDF page size (found in fuzz testing, unlikely in normal PDF files) can result in a divide-by-zero in Xpdf's text extraction code.This is related to CVE-2022-30524, but the problem here is caused by a very large page size, rather than by a very large character coordinate.
