### Description

Code injection vulnerability in Drive Explorer for macOS versions 3.5.4 and earlier allows an attacker who can login to the client where the affected product is installed to inject arbitrary code while processing the product execution. Since a full disk access privilege is required to execute LINE WORKS Drive Explorer, the attacker may be able to read and/or write to arbitrary files without the access privileges.
