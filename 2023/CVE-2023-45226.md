### Description

The BIG-IP SPK TMM (Traffic Management Module) f5-debug-sidecar and f5-debug-sshd containers contains hardcoded credentials that may allow an attacker with the ability to intercept traffic to impersonate the SPK Secure Shell (SSH) server on those containers. This is only exposed when ssh debug is enabled.  Note: Software versions which have reached End of Technical Support (EoTS) are not evaluated
