### Description

One Identity Password Manager before 5.13.1 allows Kiosk Escape. This product enables users to reset their Active Directory passwords on the login screen of a Windows client. It launches a Chromium based browser in Kiosk mode to provide the reset functionality. The escape sequence is: wait for a session timeout, click on the Help icon, observe that there is a browser window for the One Identity website, navigate to any website that offers file upload, navigate to cmd.exe from the file explorer window, and launch cmd.exe as NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM.
