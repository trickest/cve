### Description

lorawan-stack is an open source LoRaWAN network server. Prior to version 3.24.1, an open redirect exists on the login page of the lorawan stack server, allowing an attacker to supply a user controlled redirect upon sign in. This issue may allows malicious actors to phish users, as users assume they were redirected to the homepage on login. Version 3.24.1 contains a fix.
