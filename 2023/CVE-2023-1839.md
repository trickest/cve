### Description

The Product Addons & Fields for WooCommerce WordPress plugin before 32.0.6 does not sanitize and escape some of its setting fields, which could allow high-privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered_html capability is disallowed (for example, in multisite setup).
