### Description

Galaxy is an open-source platform for FAIR data analysis. Prior to version 22.05, Galaxy is vulnerable to server-side request forgery, which allows a malicious to issue arbitrary HTTP/HTTPS requests from the application server to internal hosts and read their responses. Version 22.05 contains a patch for this issue.
