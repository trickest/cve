### Description

Kiwi TCMS is an open source test management system. In versions of Kiwi TCMS prior to 12.2, users were able to update their email addresses via the `My profile` admin page. This page allowed them to change the email address registered with their account without the ownership verification performed during account registration. Operators of Kiwi TCMS should upgrade to v12.2 or later to receive a patch. No known workarounds exist.
