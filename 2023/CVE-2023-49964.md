### Description

An issue was discovered in Hyland Alfresco Community Edition through 7.2.0. By inserting malicious content in the folder.get.html.ftl file, an attacker may perform SSTI (Server-Side Template Injection) attacks, which can leverage FreeMarker exposed objects to bypass restrictions and achieve RCE (Remote Code Execution). NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2020-12873.
