### Description

In case Cacheservice was configured to use a sproxyd object-storage backend, it would follow HTTP redirects issued by that backend. An attacker with access to a local or restricted network with the capability to intercept and replay HTTP requests to sproxyd (or who is in control of the sproxyd service) could perform a server-side request-forgery attack and make Cacheservice connect to unexpected resources. We have disabled the ability to follow HTTP redirects when connecting to sproxyd resources. No publicly available exploits are known.
