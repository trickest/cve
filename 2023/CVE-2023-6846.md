### Description

The File Manager Pro plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Arbitrary File Upload in all versions up to, and including, 8.3.4 via the mk_check_filemanager_php_syntax AJAX function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber access and above, to execute code on the server. Version 8.3.5 introduces a capability check that prevents users lower than admin from executing this function.
