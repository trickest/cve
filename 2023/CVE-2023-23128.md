### Description

Connectwise Control 22.8.10013.8329 is vulnerable to Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS). The vendor's position is that two endpoints have Access-Control-Allow-Origin wildcarding to support product functionality, and that there is no risk from this behavior. The vulnerability report is thus not valid.
