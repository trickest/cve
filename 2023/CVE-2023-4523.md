### Description

Real Time Automation 460 Series products with versions prior to v8.9.8 are vulnerable to cross-site scripting, which could allow an attacker to run any JavaScript reference from the URL string. If this were to occur, the gateway's HTTP interface would redirect to the main page, which is index.htm.
