### Description

An issue was discovered on GL.iNet devices before 3.216. Through the software installation feature, it is possible to install arbitrary software, such as a reverse shell, because the restrictions on the available package list are limited to client-side verification. It is possible to install software from the filesystem, the package list, or a URL.
