### Description

The POST SMTP Mailer WordPress plugin before 2.5.7 does not have proper CSRF checks in some AJAX actions, which could allow attackers to make logged in users with the manage_postman_smtp capability resend an email to an arbitrary address (for example a password reset email could be resent to an attacker controlled email, and allow them to take over an account).
