### Description

There is a type confusion vulnerability relating to X.400 address processinginside an X.509 GeneralName. X.400 addresses were parsed as an ASN1_STRING butthe public structure definition for GENERAL_NAME incorrectly specified the typeof the x400Address field as ASN1_TYPE. This field is subsequently interpreted bythe OpenSSL function GENERAL_NAME_cmp as an ASN1_TYPE rather than anASN1_STRING.When CRL checking is enabled (i.e. the application sets theX509_V_FLAG_CRL_CHECK flag), this vulnerability may allow an attacker to passarbitrary pointers to a memcmp call, enabling them to read memory contents orenact a denial of service. In most cases, the attack requires the attacker toprovide both the certificate chain and CRL, neither of which need to have avalid signature. If the attacker only controls one of these inputs, the otherinput must already contain an X.400 address as a CRL distribution point, whichis uncommon. As such, this vulnerability is most likely to only affectapplications which have implemented their own functionality for retrieving CRLsover a network.
