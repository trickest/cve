### Description

An issue was discovered in the Feed Me plugin 4.6.1 for Craft CMS. It allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (DoS) via crafted strings to Feed-Me Name and Feed-Me URL fields, due to saving a feed using an Asset element type with no volume selected. NOTE: this is not a report about code provided by the Craft CMS product; it is only a report about the Feed Me plugin. NOTE: a third-party report states that commit b5d6ede51848349bd91bc95fec288b6793f15e28 has "nothing to do with security."
