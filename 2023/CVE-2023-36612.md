### Description

Directory traversal can occur in the Basecamp com.basecamp.bc3 application before 4.2.1 for Android, which may allow an attacker to write arbitrary files in the application's private directory. Additionally, by using a malicious intent, the attacker may redirect the server's responses (containing sensitive information) to third-party applications by using a custom-crafted deeplink scheme.
