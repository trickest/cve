### Description

An issue was discovered in Keeper Password Manager for Desktop version 16.10.2 (fixed in 17.2), and the KeeperFill Browser Extensions version 16.5.4 (fixed in 17.2), allows local attackers to gain sensitive information via plaintext password storage in memory after the user is already logged in, and may persist after logout. NOTE: the vendor disputes this for two reasons: the information is inherently available during a logged-in session when the attacker can read from arbitrary memory locations, and information only remains available after logout because of memory-management limitations of web browsers (not because the Keeper technology itself is retaining the information).
