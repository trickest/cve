### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:hwrng: core - Fix page fault dead lock on mmap-ed hwrngThere is a dead-lock in the hwrng device read path.  This triggerswhen the user reads from /dev/hwrng into memory also mmap-ed from/dev/hwrng.  The resulting page fault triggers a recursive readwhich then dead-locks.Fix this by using a stack buffer when calling copy_to_user.
