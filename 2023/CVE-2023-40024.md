### Description

ScanCode.io is a server to script and automate software composition analysis pipelines. In the `/license/` endpoint, the detailed view key is not properly validated and sanitized, which can result in a potential cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability when attempting to access a detailed license view that does not exist. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to inject malicious scripts into the response generated by the `license_details_view` function. When unsuspecting users visit the page, their browsers will execute the injected scripts, leading to unauthorized actions, session hijacking, or stealing sensitive information. This issue has been addressed in release `32.5.2`. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
