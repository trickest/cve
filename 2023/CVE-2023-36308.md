### Description

disintegration Imaging 1.6.2 allows attackers to cause a panic (because of an integer index out of range during a Grayscale call) via a crafted TIFF file to the scan function of scanner.go. NOTE: it is unclear whether there are common use cases in which this panic could have any security consequence
