### Description

Bludit v3.14.1 was discovered to contain an arbitrary file upload vulnerability in the component /admin/new-content. This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary web scripts or HTML via uploading a crafted SVG file. NOTE: the product's security model is that users are trusted by the administrator to insert arbitrary content (users cannot create their own accounts through self-registration).
