### Description

An issue was discovered in Papaya Viewer 1.0.1449. User-supplied input in form of DICOM or NIFTI images can be loaded into the Papaya web application without any kind of sanitization. This allows injection of arbitrary JavaScript code into image metadata, which is executed when that metadata is displayed in the Papaya web application.
