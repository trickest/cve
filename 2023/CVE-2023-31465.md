### Description

An issue was discovered in FSMLabs TimeKeeper 8.0.17 through 8.0.28. By intercepting requests from various timekeeper streams, it is possible to find the getsamplebacklog call. Some query parameters are passed directly in the URL and named arg[x], with x an integer starting from 1; it is possible to modify arg[2] to insert Bash code that will be executed directly by the server.
