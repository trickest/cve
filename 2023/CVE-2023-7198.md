### Description

The WP Dashboard Notes WordPress plugin before 1.0.11 is vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) in post_id= parameter. Authenticated users are able to delete private notes associated with different user accounts. This poses a significant security risk as it violates the principle of least privilege and compromises the integrity and privacy of user data.
