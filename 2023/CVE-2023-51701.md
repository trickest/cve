### Description

fastify-reply-from is a Fastify plugin to forward the current HTTP request to another server. A reverse proxy server built with `@fastify/reply-from` could misinterpret the incoming body by passing an header `ContentType: application/json ; charset=utf-8`. This can lead to bypass of security checks. This vulnerability has been patched in '@fastify/reply-from` version 9.6.0.
