### Description

An improper limitation of a path name to a restricted directory (path traversal) vulnerability in the TACC ePO extension, for on-premises ePO servers, prior to version 8.4.0 could lead to an authorised administrator attacker executing arbitrary code through uploading a specially crafted GTI reputation file. The attacker would need the appropriate privileges to access the relevant section of the User Interface. The import logic has been updated to restrict file types and content.
