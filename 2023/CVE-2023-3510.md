### Description

The FTP Access WordPress plugin through 1.0 does not have authorisation and CSRF checks when updating its settings and is missing sanitisation as well as escaping in them, allowing any authenticated users, such as subscriber to update them with XSS payloads, which will be triggered when an admin will view the settings of the plugin. The attack could also be perform via CSRF against any authenticated user.
