### Description

In Connectwise Control 22.8.10013.8329, the login page does not implement HSTS headers therefore not enforcing HTTPS. NOTE: the vendor's position is that, by design, this is controlled by a configuration option in which a customer can choose to use HTTP (rather than HTTPS) during troubleshooting.
