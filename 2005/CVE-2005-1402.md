### Description

Integer signedness error in certain older versions of the NeL library, as used in Mtp-Target 1.2.2 and earlier, and possibly other products, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption or server crash) via a negative value in a STLport call, which is not caught by a signed comparison.
