### Description

The browser user interface in Firefox before 1.0.5, Mozilla before 1.7.9, and Netscape 8.0.2 and 7.2 does not properly distinguish between user-generated events and untrusted synthetic events, which makes it easier for remote attackers to perform dangerous actions that normally could only be performed manually by the user.
