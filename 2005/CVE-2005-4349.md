### Description

SQL injection vulnerability in server_privileges.php in phpMyAdmin 2.7.0 allows remote authenticated users to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the (1) dbname and (2) checkprivs parameters.  NOTE: the vendor and a third party have disputed this issue, saying that the main task of the program is to support query execution by authenticated users, and no external attack scenario exists without an auto-login configuration.  Thus it is likely that this issue will be REJECTED.  However, a closely related CSRF issue has been assigned CVE-2005-4450
