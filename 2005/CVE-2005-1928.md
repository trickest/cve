### Description

Trend Micro ServerProtect EarthAgent for Windows Management Console 5.58 and possibly earlier versions, when running with Trend Micro Control Manager 2.5 and 3.0, and Damage Cleanup Server 1.1, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via a flood of crafted packets with a certain "magic value" to port 5005, which also leads to a memory leak.
