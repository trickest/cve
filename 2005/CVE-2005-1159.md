### Description

The native implementations of InstallTrigger and other functions in Firefox before 1.0.3 and Mozilla Suite before 1.7.7 do not properly verify the types of objects being accessed, which causes the Javascript interpreter to continue execution at the wrong memory address, which may allow attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code by passing objects of the wrong type.
