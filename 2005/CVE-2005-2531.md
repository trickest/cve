### Description

OpenVPN before 2.0.1, when running with "verb 0" and without TLS authentication, does not properly flush the OpenSSL error queue when a client fails certificate authentication to the server and causes the error to be processed by the wrong client, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (client disconnection) via a large number of failed authentication attempts.
