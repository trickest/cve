### Description

** DISPUTED **  Dragonfly Commerce allows remote attackers to change a product price by modifying the x_DragonflyCartProductPrice hidden field to (1) dc_Categorieslist.asp, (2) dc_Categoriesview.asp, (3) dc_productslist.asp, and (4) dc_productslist_Clearance.asp.  NOTE: the vendor has disputed this issue, saying that "Dragonfly Commerce does not allow for editing prices nor does it allow for viewing information about clients stored in the database except by the store owner and authorized staff as appointed in the store administration."  However, SecurityTracker claims that they have been able to confirm the problem.
