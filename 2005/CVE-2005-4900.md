### Description

SHA-1 is not collision resistant, which makes it easier for context-dependent attackers to conduct spoofing attacks, as demonstrated by attacks on the use of SHA-1 in TLS 1.2.  NOTE: this CVE exists to provide a common identifier for referencing this SHA-1 issue; the existence of an identifier is not, by itself, a technology recommendation.
