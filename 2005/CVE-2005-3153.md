### Description

login.php in myBloggie 2.1.3 beta and earlier allows remote attackers to bypass a whitelist regular expression and conduct SQL injection attacks via a username parameter with SQL after a null character, which causes the whitelist check to succeed but injects the SQL into a query string, a different vulnerability than CVE-2005-2838.  NOTE: it is possible that this is actually a bug in PHP code, in which case this should not be treated as a myBloggie vulnerability.
