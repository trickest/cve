### Description

setting.php in Innovative CMS (ICMS, formerly Imoel-CMS) contains username and password information in cleartext, which might allow attackers to obtain this information via a direct request to setting.php. NOTE: on a properly configured web server, it would be expected that a .php file would be processed before content is returned to the user, so this might not be a vulnerability.
