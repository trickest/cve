### Description

Multiple games developed by FUN labs, including 4X4 Off-road Adventure III, Big Game Hunter, Dangerous Hunts, Deer Hunt, Revolution, Secret Service, Shadow Force, and US Most Wanted, allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service via an empty UDP packet to the server, which cannot detect that a new packet has arrived using the socket ioctl.
