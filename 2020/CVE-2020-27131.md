### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities in the Java deserialization function that is used by Cisco Security Manager could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on an affected device. These vulnerabilities are due to insecure deserialization of user-supplied content by the affected software. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a malicious serialized Java object to a specific listener on an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the device with the privileges of NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM on the Windows target host. Cisco has not released software updates that address these vulnerabilities.
