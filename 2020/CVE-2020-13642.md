### Description

An issue was discovered in the SiteOrigin Page Builder plugin before 2.10.16 for WordPress. The action_builder_content function did not do any nonce verification, allowing for requests to be forged on behalf of an administrator. The panels_data $_POST variable allows for malicious JavaScript to be executed in the victim's browser.
