### Description

The O2 Business application 1.2.0 for Android exposes the canvasm.myo2.SplashActivity activity to other applications. The purpose of this activity is to handle deeplinks that can be delivered either via links or by directly calling the activity. However, the deeplink format is not properly validated. This can be abused by an attacker to redirect a user to any page and deliver any content to the user.
