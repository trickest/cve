### Description

A vulnerability in task group assignment for a specific CLI command in Cisco IOS XR Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to execute that command, even though administrative privileges should be required. The attacker must have valid credentials on the affected device. The vulnerability is due to incorrect mapping in the source code of task group assignments for a specific command. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by issuing the command, which they should not be authorized to issue, on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to invalidate the integrity of the disk and cause the device to restart. This vulnerability could allow a user with read permissions to issue a specific command that should require Administrator privileges.
