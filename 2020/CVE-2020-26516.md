### Description

A CSRF issue was discovered in Intland codeBeamer ALM 10.x through 10.1.SP4. Requests sent to the server that trigger actions do not contain a CSRF token and can therefore be entirely predicted allowing attackers to cause the victim's browser to execute undesired actions in the web application through crafted requests.
