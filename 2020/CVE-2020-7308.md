### Description

Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information between McAfee Endpoint Security (ENS) for Windows prior to 10.7.0 February 2021 Update and McAfee Global Threat Intelligence (GTI) servers using DNS allows a remote attacker to view the requests from ENS and responses from GTI over DNS. By gaining control of an intermediate DNS server or altering the network DNS configuration, it is possible for an attacker to intercept requests and send their own responses.
