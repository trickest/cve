### Description

In Patient Information Center iX (PICiX) Versions B.02, C.02, C.03, the product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource. The application on the surveillance station operates in kiosk mode, which is vulnerable to local breakouts that could allow an attacker with physical access to escape the restricted environment with limited privileges.
