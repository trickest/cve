### Description

Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.20 to 2.4.43 When trace/debug was enabled for the HTTP/2 module and on certain traffic edge patterns, logging statements were made on the wrong connection, causing concurrent use of memory pools. Configuring the LogLevel of mod_http2 above "info" will mitigate this vulnerability for unpatched servers.
