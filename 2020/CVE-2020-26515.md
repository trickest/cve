### Description

An insufficiently protected credentials issue was discovered in Intland codeBeamer ALM 10.x through 10.1.SP4. The remember-me cookie (CB_LOGIN) issued by the application contains the encrypted user's credentials. However, due to a bug in the application code, those credentials are encrypted using a NULL encryption key.
