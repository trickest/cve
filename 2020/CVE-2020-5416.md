### Description

Cloud Foundry Routing (Gorouter), versions prior to 0.204.0, when used in a deployment with NGINX reverse proxies in front of the Gorouters, is potentially vulnerable to denial-of-service attacks in which an unauthenticated malicious attacker can send specially-crafted HTTP requests that may cause the Gorouters to be dropped from the NGINX backend pool.
