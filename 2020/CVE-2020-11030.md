### Description

In affected versions of WordPress, a special payload can be crafted that can lead to scripts getting executed within the search block of the block editor. This requires an authenticated user with the ability to add content. This has been patched in version 5.4.1, along with all the previously affected versions via a minor release (5.3.3, 5.2.6, 5.1.5, 5.0.9, 4.9.14, 4.8.13, 4.7.17, 4.6.18, 4.5.21, 4.4.22, 4.3.23, 4.2.27, 4.1.30, 4.0.30, 3.9.31, 3.8.33, 3.7.33).
