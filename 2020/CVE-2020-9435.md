### Description

PHOENIX CONTACT TC ROUTER 3002T-4G through 2.05.3, TC ROUTER 2002T-3G through 2.05.3, TC ROUTER 3002T-4G VZW through 2.05.3, TC ROUTER 3002T-4G ATT through 2.05.3, TC CLOUD CLIENT 1002-4G through 2.03.17, and TC CLOUD CLIENT 1002-TXTX through 1.03.17 devices contain a hardcoded certificate (and key) that is used by default for web-based services on the device.
