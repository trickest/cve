### Description

Some devices of Thales DIS (formerly Gemalto, formerly Cinterion) allow Directory Traversal by physically proximate attackers. The directory path access check of the internal flash file system can be circumvented. This flash file system can store application-specific data and data needed for customer Java applications, TLS and OTAP (Java over-the-air-provisioning) functionality. The affected products and releases are: BGS5 up to and including SW RN 02.000 / ARN 01.001.06 EHSx and PDSx up to and including SW RN 04.003 / ARN 01.000.04 ELS61 up to and including SW RN 02.002 / ARN 01.000.04 ELS81 up to and including SW RN 05.002 / ARN 01.000.04 PLS62 up to and including SW RN 02.000 / ARN 01.000.04
