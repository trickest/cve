### Description

The Telnet service of Rubetek cameras RV-3406, RV-3409, and RV-3411 cameras (firmware versions v342, v339) could allow an remote attacker to take full control of the device with a high-privileged account. The vulnerability exists because a system account has a default and static password. The Telnet service cannot be disabled and this password cannot be changed via standard functionality.
