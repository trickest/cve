### Description

Castel NextGen DVR v1.0.0 is vulnerable to privilege escalation through the Adminstrator/Users/Edit/:UserId functionality. Adminstrator/Users/Edit/:UserId fails to check that the request was submitted by an Administrator. This allows a normal user to escalate their privileges by adding additional roles to their account.
