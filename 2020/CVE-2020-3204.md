### Description

A vulnerability in the Tool Command Language (Tcl) interpreter of Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker with privileged EXEC credentials to execute arbitrary code on the underlying operating system (OS) with root privileges. The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of data passed to the Tcl interpreter. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by loading malicious Tcl code on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause memory corruption or execute the code with root privileges on the underlying OS of the affected device.
