### Description

An issue was discovered in BT CTROMS Terminal OS Port Portal CT-464. Account takeover can occur because the password-reset feature discloses the verification token. Upon a getverificationcode.jsp request, this token is transmitted not only to the registered phone number of the user account, but is also transmitted to the unauthenticated HTTP client.
