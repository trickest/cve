### Description

A vulnerability in Trend Micro Apex One, OfficeScan XG SP1, Worry-Free Business Security 10 SP1 and Worry-Free Business Security Services on Microsoft Windows may allow an attacker to create a hard link to any file on the system, which then could be manipulated to gain a privilege escalation and code execution. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability. Please note that version 1909 (OS Build 18363.719) of Microsoft Windows 10 mitigates hard links, but previous versions are affected.
