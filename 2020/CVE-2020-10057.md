### Description

GeniXCMS 1.1.7 is vulnerable to user privilege escalation due to broken access control. This issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2015-2680, in which "token" is used as a CSRF protection mechanism, but without validation that "token" is associated with an administrative user.
