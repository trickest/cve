### Description

A vulnerability in the Kerberos authentication feature of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to impersonate the Kerberos key distribution center (KDC) and bypass authentication on an affected device that is configured to perform Kerberos authentication for VPN or local device access. The vulnerability is due to insufficient identity verification of the KDC when a successful authentication response is received. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by spoofing the KDC server response to the ASA device. This malicious response would not have been authenticated by the KDC. A successful attack could allow an attacker to bypass Kerberos authentication.
