### Description

In the Macally WIFISD2-2A82 Media and Travel Router 2.000.010, the Guest user is able to reset its own password. This process has a vulnerability which can be used to take over the administrator account and results in shell access. As the admin user may read the /etc/shadow file, the password hashes of each user (including root) can be dumped. The root hash can be cracked easily which results in a complete system compromise.
