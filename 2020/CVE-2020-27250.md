### Description

In SoftMaker Software GmbH SoftMaker Office PlanMaker 2021 (Revision 1014), a specially crafted document can cause the document parser to copy data from a particular record type into a static-sized buffer within an object that is smaller than the size used for the copy, which will cause a heap-based buffer overflow at Version/Instance 0x0005 and 0x0016. An attacker can entice the victim to open a document to trigger this vulnerability.
