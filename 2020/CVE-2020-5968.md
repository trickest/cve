NVIDIA Virtual GPU Manager contains a vulnerability in the vGPU plugin, in which the software does not restrict or incorrectly restricts operations within the boundaries of a resource that is accessed by using an index or pointer, such as memory or files, which may lead to code execution, denial of service, escalation of privileges, or information disclosure. This affects vGPU version 8.x (prior to 8.4), version 9.x (prior to 9.4) and version 10.x (prior to 10.3).
