### Description

Nessus 8.10.0 and earlier were found to contain a Stored XSS vulnerability due to improper validation of input during scan configuration. An authenticated, remote attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code in a user's session. Tenable has implemented additional input validation mechanisms to correct this issue in Nessus 8.11.0.
