### Description

An issue was discovered in beta versions of the 1Password command-line tool prior to 0.5.5 and in beta versions of the 1Password SCIM bridge prior to 0.7.3. An insecure random number generator was used to generate various keys. An attacker with access to the user's encrypted data may be able to perform brute-force calculations of encryption keys and thus succeed at decryption.
