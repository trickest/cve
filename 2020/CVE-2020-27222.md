### Description

In Eclipse Californium version 2.3.0 to 2.6.0, the certificate based (x509 and RPK) DTLS handshakes accidentally fails, because the DTLS server side sticks to a wrong internal state. That wrong internal state is set by a previous certificate based DTLS handshake failure with TLS parameter mismatch. The DTLS server side must be restarted to recover this. This allow clients to force a DoS.
