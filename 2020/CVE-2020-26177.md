### Description

In tangro Business Workflow before 1.18.1, a user's profile contains some items that are greyed out and thus are not intended to be edited by regular users. However, this restriction is only applied client-side. Manipulating any of the greyed-out values in requests to /api/profile is not prohibited server-side.
