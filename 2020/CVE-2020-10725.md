### Description

A flaw was found in DPDK version 19.11 and above that allows a malicious guest to cause a segmentation fault of the vhost-user backend application running on the host, which could result in a loss of connectivity for the other guests running on that host. This is caused by a missing validity check of the descriptor address in the function `virtio_dev_rx_batch_packed()`.
