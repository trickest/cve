### Description

app/Model/feed.php in MISP before 2.4.124 allows administrators to choose arbitrary files that should be ingested by MISP. This does not cause a leak of the full contents of a file, but does cause a leaks of strings that match certain patterns. Among the data that can leak are passwords from database.php or GPG key passphrases from config.php.
