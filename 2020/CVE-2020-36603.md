### Description

The HoYoVerse (formerly miHoYo) Genshin Impact mhyprot2.sys 1.0.0.0 anti-cheat driver does not adequately restrict unprivileged function calls, allowing local, unprivileged users to execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges on Microsoft Windows systems. The mhyprot2.sys driver must first be installed by a user with administrative privileges.
