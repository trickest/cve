### Description

tangro Business Workflow before 1.18.1 requests a list of allowed filetypes from the server and restricts uploads to the filetypes contained in this list. However, this restriction is enforced in the browser (client-side) and can be circumvented. This allows an attacker to upload any file as an attachment to a workitem.
