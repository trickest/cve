### Description

Archer before 6.8 P2 (6.8.0.2) is affected by an open redirect vulnerability. A remote privileged attacker may potentially redirect legitimate users to arbitrary web sites and conduct phishing attacks. The attacker could then steal the victims' credentials and silently authenticate them to the Archer application without the victims realizing an attack occurred.
