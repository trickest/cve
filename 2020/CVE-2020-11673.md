### Description

An issue was discovered in the Responsive Poll through 1.3.4 for Wordpress. It allows an unauthenticated user to manipulate polls, e.g., delete, clone, or view a hidden poll. This is due to the usage of the callback wp_ajax_nopriv function in Includes/Total-Soft-Poll-Ajax.php for sensitive operations.
