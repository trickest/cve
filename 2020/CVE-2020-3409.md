### Description

A vulnerability in the PROFINET feature of Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause an affected device to crash and reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition on the device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient processing logic for crafted PROFINET packets that are sent to an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted PROFINET packets to an affected device for processing. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to crash and reload, resulting in a DoS condition on the device.
