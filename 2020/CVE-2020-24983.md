### Description

An issue was discovered in Quadbase EspressReports ES 7 Update 9. An unauthenticated attacker can create a malicious HTML file that houses a POST request made to the DashboardBuilder within the target web application. This request will utilise the target admin session and perform the authenticated request (to change the Dashboard name) as if the victim had done so themselves, aka CSRF.
