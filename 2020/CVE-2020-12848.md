### Description

In Pydio Cells 2.0.4, once an authenticated user shares a file selecting the create a public link option, a hidden shared user account is created in the backend with a random username. An anonymous user that obtains a valid public link can get the associated hidden account username and password and proceed to login to the web application. Once logged into the web application with the hidden user account, some actions that were not available with the public share link can now be performed.
