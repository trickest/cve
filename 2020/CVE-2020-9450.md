### Description

An issue was discovered in Acronis True Image 2020 24.5.22510. anti_ransomware_service.exe exposes a REST API that can be used by everyone, even unprivileged users. This API is used to communicate from the GUI to anti_ransomware_service.exe. This can be exploited to add an arbitrary malicious executable to the whitelist, or even exclude an entire drive from being monitored by anti_ransomware_service.exe.
