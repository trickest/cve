### Description

SAP NetWeaver AS JAVA, versions - 7.20, 7.30, 7.31, 7.40, 7.50, allows an attacker who is authenticated as an administrator to use the administrator console, to expose unauthenticated access to the file system and upload a malicious file. The attacker or another user can then use a separate mechanism to execute OS commands through the uploaded file leading to Privilege Escalation and completely compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the server operating system and any application running on it.
