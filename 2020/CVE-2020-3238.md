### Description

A vulnerability in the Cisco Application Framework component of the Cisco IOx application environment could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to write or modify arbitrary files in the virtual instance that is running on the affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of user-supplied application packages. An attacker who can upload a malicious package within Cisco IOx could exploit the vulnerability to modify arbitrary files. The impacts of a successful exploit are limited to the scope of the virtual instance and do not affect the device that is hosting Cisco IOx.
