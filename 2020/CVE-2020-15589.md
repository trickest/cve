### Description

A design issue was discovered in GetInternetRequestHandle, InternetSendRequestEx and InternetSendRequestByBitrate in the client side of Zoho ManageEngine Desktop Central 10.0.552.W and Remote Access Plus before 10.1.2119.1. By exploiting this issue, an attacker-controlled server can force the client to skip TLS certificate validation, leading to a man-in-the-middle attack against HTTPS and unauthenticated remote code execution.
