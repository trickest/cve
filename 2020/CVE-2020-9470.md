### Description

An issue was discovered in Wing FTP Server 6.2.5 before February 2020. Due to insecure permissions when handling session cookies, a local user may view the contents of the session and session_admin directories, which expose active session cookies within the Wing FTP HTTP interface and administration panel. These cookies may be used to hijack user and administrative sessions, including the ability to execute Lua commands as root within the administration panel.
