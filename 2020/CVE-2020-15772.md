### Description

An issue was discovered in Gradle Enterprise 2018.5 - 2020.2.4. When configuring Gradle Enterprise to integrate with a SAML identity provider, an XML metadata file can be uploaded by an administrator. The server side processing of this file dereferences XML External Entities (XXE), allowing a remote attacker with administrative access to perform server side request forgery.
