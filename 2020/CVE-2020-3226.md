### Description

A vulnerability in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) library of Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to trigger a reload of an affected device, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanity checks on received SIP messages. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted SIP messages to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to reload, resulting in a denial of service condition.
