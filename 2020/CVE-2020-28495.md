### Description

This affects the package total.js before 3.4.7. The set function can be used to set a value into the object according to the path. However the keys of the path being set are not properly sanitized, leading to a prototype pollution vulnerability. The impact depends on the application. In some cases it is possible to achieve Denial of service (DoS), Remote Code Execution or Property Injection.
