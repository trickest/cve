### Description

node-prompt-here through 1.0.1 allows execution of arbitrary commands. The "runCommand()" is called by "getDevices()" function in file "linux/manager.js", which is required by the "index. process.env.NM_CLI" in the file "linux/manager.js". This function is used to construct the argument of function "execSync()", which can be controlled by users without any sanitization.
