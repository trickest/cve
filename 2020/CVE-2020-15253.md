### Description

Versions of Grocy <= 2.7.1 are vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting via the Create Shopping List module, that is rendered upon deleting that Shopping List. The issue was also found in users, batteries, chores, equipment, locations, quantity units, shopping locations, tasks, taskcategories, product groups, recipes and products. Authentication is required to exploit these issues and Grocy should not be publicly exposed. The linked reference details a proof-of-concept.
