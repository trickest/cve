### Description

An issue was discovered in tools/pass-change/result.php in phpIPAM 1.4. CSRF can be used to change the password of any user/admin, to escalate privileges, and to gain access to more data and functionality. This issue exists due to the lack of a requirement to provide the old password, and the lack of security tokens.
