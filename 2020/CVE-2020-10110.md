### Description

** DISPUTED ** Citrix Gateway 11.1, 12.0, and 12.1 allows Information Exposure Through Caching. NOTE: Citrix disputes this as not a vulnerability. There is no sensitive information disclosure through the cache headers on Citrix ADC. The "Via" header lists cache protocols and recipients between the start and end points for a request or a response. The "Age" header provides the age of the cached response in seconds. Both headers are commonly used for proxy cache and the information is not sensitive.
