### Description

** UNSUPPORTED WHEN ASSIGNED ** Leostream Connection Broker 8.2.x is affected by stored XSS. An unauthenticated attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code via the webquery.pl User-Agent HTTP header. It is rendered by the admins the next time they log in. The JavaScript injected can be used to force the admin to upload a malicious Perl script that will be executed as root via libMisc::browser_client. NOTE: This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer.
