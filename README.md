## How it works
### [Trickest](https://trickest.com) Workflow Architecture

![Trickest Workflow - PoC](workflow.png "Trickest Workflow - PoC")

### TB; DZ (Too big; didn't zoom):
- Collect CVE details from [cvelist](https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelist) (Shout out to [CVE Project](https://github.com/CVEProject)!)
- Split CVEs up by year.
- Find PoCs for each CVE using 2 techniques:
    1. References
        - Gather each CVE's `References`.
        - Check if any of them points to a PoC using [ffuf](https://github.com/ffuf/ffuf) and a list of keywords

         Regex:
         ```(?i)[^a-z0-9]+(poc|proof of concept|proof[-_]of[-_]concept)[^a-z0-9]+```

         (Thanks [@joohoi](https://github.com/joohoi)!)
         
         **Note**: [ffuf](https://github.com/ffuf/ffuf) is awesome for more purposes than just content discovery.

         Get CVE referenced in HackerOne Reports - [AllVideoPocsFromHackerOne](https://github.com/zeroc00I/AllVideoPocsFromHackerOne) (Thanks [@zeroc00I](https://github.com/zeroc00I)!)


    2. Github
        
        Search GitHub for repositories with [find-gh-poc](https://github.com/trickest/find-gh-poc) that mention the CVE ID.
- Merge the fresh results into the repository without overwriting the data that was committed manually.
- Filter false positives using `blacklist.txt`.
- Merge all of the found PoCs.
- Generate GitHub badges for each affected software version using [shields.io](https://shields.io).
- Write everything into easy-to-read markdown files.



> **As described, almost everything in this repository is generated automatically. We carefully designed the workflow (and continue to develop it) to ensure the results are as accurate as possible.**



## Use cases 
- Browse around, find a nice PoC, and test away!
- `Watch` the repository to receive notifications about new PoCs as soon as they go public.
- Search for a specific product(s) (and possibly version) to find all public exploits related to it.
- Monitor the [atom feed](https://github.com/trickest/cve/commits/main.atom) for a specific product(s).
- Create a searchable HTML table using the template and script in [summary_html](summary_html)
    - Example: https://www.andrewmohawk.com/cve_summary (Thanks [@AndrewMohawk](https://github.com/AndrewMohawk)!)
