### Description

PubNet is a self-hosted Dart & Flutter package service. Prior to version 1.1.3, the /api/storage/upload endpoint in PubNet allows unauthenticated users to upload packages as any user by providing arbitrary author-id values. This enables identity spoofing, privilege escalation, and supply chain attacks. This issue has been patched in version 1.1.3.
