### Description

Prior to 4.4.1 and 4.4.1-beta.2, an Authenticated User can delete collections belonging to other users by directly sending a DELETE request to the collection endpoint. No ownership verification is performed before deleting collections. This vulnerability is fixed in 4.4.1 and 4.4.1-beta.2.
