### Description

Versions of the package fastapi-sso before 0.19.0 are vulnerable to Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF) due to the improper validation of the OAuth state parameter during the authentication callback. While the get_login_url method allows for state generation, it does not persist the state or bind it to the user's session. Consequently, the verify_and_process method accepts the state received in the query parameters without verifying it against a trusted local value. This allows a remote attacker to trick a victim into visiting a malicious callback URL, which can result in the attacker's account being linked to the victim's internal account.
