### Description

Xtooltech Xtool AnyScan Android Application 4.40.40 and prior uses a hardcoded cryptographic key and IV to decrypt update metadata. The key is stored as a static value within the application's code. An attacker with the ability to intercept network traffic can use this hardcoded key to decrypt, modify, and re-encrypt the update manifest, allowing them to direct the application to download a malicious update package.
