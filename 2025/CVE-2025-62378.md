### Description

CommandKit is the discord.js meta-framework for building Discord bots. In versions 1.2.0-rc.1 through 1.2.0-rc.11, a logic flaw exists in the message command handler that affects how the commandName property is exposed to both middleware functions and command execution contexts when handling command aliases. When a message command is invoked using an alias, the ctx.commandName value reflects the alias rather than the canonical command name. This occurs in both middleware functions and within the command's own run function. Although not explicitly documented, CommandKit's examples and guidance around middleware usage implicitly convey that ctx.commandName represents the canonical command identifier. Middleware examples in the documentation consistently use ctx.commandName to reference the command being executed. Developers who assume ctx.commandName is canonical may introduce unintended behavior when relying on it for logic such as permission checks, rate limiting, or audit logging. This could allow unauthorized command execution or inaccurate access control decisions. Slash commands and context menu commands are not affected. This issue has been patched in version 1.2.0-rc.12, where ctx.commandName now consistently returns the actual canonical command name regardless of the alias used to invoke it.
