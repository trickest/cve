### Description

NetSupport Manager < 14.12.0001 contains an arbitrary file write vulnerability in its Connectivity Server/Gateway PUTFILE request handler. An attacker with a valid Gateway Key can supply a crafted filename containing directory traversal sequences to write files to arbitrary locations on the server. This can be leveraged to place attacker-controlled DLLs or executables in privileged paths and achieve remote code execution in the context of the NetSupport Manager connectivity service.
