### Description

A DOM-based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the SelfBest platform 2023.3 allows attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of a logged-in user's session by injecting payloads via the browser's developer console. The vulnerability arises from the application's client-side code being susceptible to direct DOM manipulation without adequate sanitization or a Content Security Policy (CSP), potentially leading to account takeover and data theft.
