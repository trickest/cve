### Description

The WP Fastest Cache plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.7.4 via the 'get_server_time_ajax_request' AJAX action. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to make web requests to arbitrary locations originating from the web application and can be used to query and modify information from internal services.
