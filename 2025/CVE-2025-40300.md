### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:x86/vmscape: Add conditional IBPB mitigationVMSCAPE is a vulnerability that exploits insufficient branch predictorisolation between a guest and a userspace hypervisor (like QEMU). Existingmitigations already protect kernel/KVM from a malicious guest. Userspacecan additionally be protected by flushing the branch predictors after aVMexit.Since it is the userspace that consumes the poisoned branch predictors,conditionally issue an IBPB after a VMexit and before returning touserspace. Workloads that frequently switch between hypervisor anduserspace will incur the most overhead from the new IBPB.This new IBPB is not integrated with the existing IBPB sites. Forinstance, a task can use the existing speculation control prctl() toget an IBPB at context switch time. With this implementation, theIBPB is doubled up: one at context switch and another before runninguserspace.The intent is to integrate and optimize these cases post-embargo.[ dhansen: elaborate on suboptimal IBPB solution ]
