### Description

Cybersecurity AI (CAI) is an open-source framework for building and deploying AI-powered offensive and defensive automation. Versions 0.5.9 and below are vulnerable to Command Injection through the run_ssh_command_with_credentials() function, which is  available to AI agents. Only password and command inputs are escaped in run_ssh_command_with_credentials to prevent shell injection; while username, host and port values are injectable. This issue does not have a fix at the time of publication.
