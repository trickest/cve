### Description

The Kalrav AI Agent plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the kalrav_upload_file AJAX action in all versions up to, and including, 2.3.3. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.
