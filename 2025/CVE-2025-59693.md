### Description

The Chassis Management Board in Entrust nShield Connect XC, nShield 5c, and nShield HSMi through 13.6.11, or 13.7, allows a physically proximate attacker to obtain debug access and escalate privileges by bypassing the tamper label and opening the chassis without leaving evidence, and accessing the JTAG connector. This is called F02.
