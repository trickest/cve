### Description

Wazuh is a free and open source platform used for threat prevention, detection, and response. From version 3.7.0 to before 4.12.0, fim_alert() implementation does not check whether oldsum->md5 is NULL or not before dereferencing it. A compromised agent can cause a crash of analysisd by sending a specially crafted message to the wazuh manager. This issue has been patched in version 4.12.0.
