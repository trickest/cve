### Description

A weakness has been identified in sunkaifei FlyCMS up to abbaa5a8daefb146ad4d61027035026b052cb414. The impacted element is the function userLogin of the file src/main/java/com/flycms/web/front/UserController.java of the component User Login. Executing a manipulation of the argument redirectUrl can lead to cross site scripting. The attack can be launched remotely. The exploit has been made available to the public and could be used for attacks. This product does not use versioning. This is why information about affected and unaffected releases are unavailable.
