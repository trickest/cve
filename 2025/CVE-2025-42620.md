### Description

In affected versions, vulnerability-lookup handled user-controlled content in comments and bundles in an unsafe way, which could lead to stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).On the backend, the related_vulnerabilities field of bundles accepted arbitrary strings without format validation or proper sanitization. On the frontend, comment and bundle descriptions were converted from Markdown to HTML and then injected directly into the DOM using string templates and innerHTML. This combination allowed an attacker who could create or edit comments or bundles to store crafted HTML/JavaScript payloads which would later be rendered and executed in the browser of any user visiting the affected profile page (user.html). This issue affects Vulnerability-Lookup: before 2.18.0.
