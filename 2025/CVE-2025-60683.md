### Description

A command injection vulnerability exists in the ToToLink A720R Router firmware V4.1.5cu.614_B20230630 within the sysconf binary, specifically in the sub_40BFA4 function that handles network interface reinitialization from '/var/system/linux_vlan_reinit'. Input is only partially validated by checking the prefix of interface names, and is concatenated into shell commands executed via system() without escaping. An attacker with write access to this file can execute arbitrary commands on the device.
