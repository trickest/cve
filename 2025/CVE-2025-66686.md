### Description

A stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in Perch CMS version 3.2. An authenticated attacker with administrative privileges can inject malicious JavaScript code into the “Help button url” setting within the admin panel. The injected payload is stored and executed when any authenticated user clicks the Help button, potentially leading to session hijacking, information disclosure, privilege escalation, and unauthorized administrative actions.
