### Description

The WP Fastest Cache plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the wpfc_db_fix_callback() function in all versions up to, and including, 1.4.0. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to initiate several database fix actions. This only affects sites with premium activated.
