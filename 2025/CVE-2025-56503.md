### Description

An issue in Sublime HQ Pty Ltd Sublime Text 4 4200 allows authenticated attackers with low-level privileges to escalate privileges to Administrator via replacing the uninstall file with a crafted binary in the installation folder. NOTE: this is disputed by the Supplier because replacing the uninstall file requires administrator permissions, i.e., there is no privilege escalation.
