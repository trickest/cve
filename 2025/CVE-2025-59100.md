### Description

The web interface offers a functionality to export the internal SQLite database. After executing the database export, an automatic download is started and the device reboots. After rebooting, the exported database is deleted and cannot be accessed anymore. However, it was noticed that sometimes the device does not reboot and therefore the exported database is not deleted, or the device reboots and the export is not deleted for unknown reasons. The path where the database export is located can be accessed without prior authentication. This leads to the fact that an attacker might be able to get access to the exported database without prior authentication. The database includes sensitive data like passwords, card pins, encrypted Mifare sitekeys and much more.
