### Description

WeGIA is an open source web manager with a focus on the Portuguese language and charitable institutions. A Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability was identified in the `editar_socio.php` endpoint of the WeGIA application. This vulnerability allows attackers to inject malicious scripts in the `socio` parameter. The application fails to validate and sanitize user inputs in the `socio` parameter. This lack of validation permits the injection of malicious payloads, which are reflected back to the user's browser in the server's response and executed within the context of the victim's browser. This issue has been addressed in version 3.2.7 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
