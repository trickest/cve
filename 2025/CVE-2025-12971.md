### Description

The Folders – Unlimited Folders to Organize Media Library Folder, Pages, Posts, File Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a misconfigured capability check on the 'wcp_change_post_folder' function in all versions up to, and including, 3.1.5. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to move arbitrary folder contents to arbitrary folders.
