### Description

Quark Cloud Drive v3.23.2 has a DLL Hijacking vulnerability. This vulnerability stems from the insecure loading of system libraries. Specifically, the application does not validate the path or signature of [regsvr32.exe] it loads. An attacker can place a crafted malicious DLL in the application's startup directory, which will be loaded and executed when the user launches the program.
