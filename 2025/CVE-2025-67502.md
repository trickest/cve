### Description

Taguette is an open source qualitative research tool. In versions 1.5.1 and below,  attackers can craft malicious URLs that redirect users to arbitrary external websites after authentication. The application accepts a user-controlled next parameter and uses it directly in HTTP redirects without any validation. This can be exploited for phishing attacks where victims believe they are interacting with a trusted Taguette instance but are redirected to a malicious site designed to steal credentials or deliver malware. This issue is fixed in version 1.5.2.
