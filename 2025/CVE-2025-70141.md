### Description

SourceCodester Customer Support System 1.0 contains an incorrect access control vulnerability in ajax.php. The AJAX dispatcher does not enforce authentication or authorization before invoking administrative methods in admin_class.php based on the action parameter. An unauthenticated remote attacker can perform sensitive operations such as creating customers and deleting users (including the admin account), as well as modifying or deleting other application records (tickets, departments, comments), resulting in unauthorized data modification.
