### Description

An issue was discovered in Foxit PDF and Editor for Windows and macOS before 13.2 and 2025 before 2025.2. They allow potential arbitrary code execution when processing crafted PDF files. The vulnerability stems from insufficient handling of memory allocation failures after assigning an extremely large value to a form field's charLimit property via JavaScript. This can result in memory corruption and may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code by persuading a user to open a malicious file.
