### Description

SillyTavern is a locally installed user interface that allows users to interact with text generation large language models, image generation engines, and text-to-speech voice models. In versions prior to 1.13.4, the web user interface for SillyTavern is susceptible to DNS rebinding, allowing attackers to perform actions like install malicious extensions, read chats, inject arbitrary HTML for phishing attacks, etc. The vulnerability has been patched in the version 1.13.4 by introducing a server configuration setting that enables a validation of host names in inbound HTTP requests according to the provided list of allowed hosts: `hostWhitelist.enabled` in config.yaml file or `SILLYTAVERN_HOSTWHITELIST_ENABLED` environment variable. While the setting is disabled by default to honor a wide variety of existing user configurations and maintain backwards compatibility, existing and new users are encouraged to review their server configurations and apply necessary changes to their setup, especially if hosting over the local network while not using SSL.
