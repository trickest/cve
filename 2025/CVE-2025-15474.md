### Description

AuntyFey Smart Combination Lock firmware versions as of 2025-12-24 contain a vulnerability that allows an unauthenticated attacker within Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) range to cause a denial of service by repeatedly initiating BLE connections. Sustained connection attempts interrupt keypad authentication input and repeatedly force the device into lockout states, preventing legitimate users from unlocking the device.
