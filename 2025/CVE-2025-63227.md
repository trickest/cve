### Description

The Mozart FM Transmitter web management interface on version WEBMOZZI-00287, contains an unrestricted file upload vulnerability in the /patch.php endpoint. An attacker with administrative credentials can upload arbitrary files (e.g., PHP webshells), which are stored in the /patch/ directory. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server, potentially leading to full system compromise.
