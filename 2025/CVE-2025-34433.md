### Description

AVideo versions 14.3.1 prior to 20.1 contain an unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability caused by predictable generation of an installation salt using PHP uniqid(). The installation timestamp is exposed via a public endpoint, and a derived hash identifier is accessible through unauthenticated API responses, allowing attackers to brute-force the remaining entropy. The recovered salt can then be used to encrypt a malicious payload supplied to a notification API endpoint that evaluates attacker-controlled input, resulting in arbitrary code execution as the web server user.
