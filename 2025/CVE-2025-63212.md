### Description

GatesAir Flexiva-LX devices on firmware 1.0.13 and 2.0, including models LX100, LX300, LX600, and LX1000, expose sensitive session identifiers (sid) in the publicly accessible log file located at /log/Flexiva%20LX.log. An unauthenticated attacker can retrieve valid session IDs and hijack sessions without providing any credentials.
