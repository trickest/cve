### Description

The Access Manager is offering a trace functionality to debug errors and issues with the device. The trace functionality is implemented as a simple TCP socket. A tool called TraceClient.exe, provided by dormakaba via the Access Manager web interface, is used to connect to the socket and receive debug information. The data is permanently broadcasted on the TCP socket. The socket can be accessed without any authentication or encryption. The transmitted data is based on the set verbosity level. The verbosity level can be set using the http(s) endpoint with the service interface password or with the guessable identifier of the device via the SOAP interface.The transmitted data contains sensitive data like the Card ID as well as all button presses on Registration units. This allows an attacker with network level access to retrieve all entered PINs on a registration unit.
