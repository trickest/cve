### Description

A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the Digital IDs functionality of the Foxit PDF Editor Cloud (pdfonline.foxit.com). The application does not properly sanitize or encode the Common Name field of Digital IDs before inserting user-supplied content into the DOM. As a result, embedded HTML or JavaScript may execute whenever the Digital IDs dialog is accessed or when the affected PDF is loaded.
