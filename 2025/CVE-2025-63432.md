### Description

Xtooltech Xtool AnyScan Android Application 4.40.40 and prior is Missing SSL Certificate Validation. The application fails to properly validate the TLS certificate from its update server. An attacker on the same network can exploit this vulnerability by performing a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack to intercept, decrypt, and modify traffic between the application and the update server. This serves as the basis for further attacks, including Remote Code Execution.
