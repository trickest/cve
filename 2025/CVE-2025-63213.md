### Description

The QVidium Opera11 device (firmware version 2.9.0-Ax4x-opera11) is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution (RCE) due to improper input validation on the /cgi-bin/net_ping.cgi endpoint. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted GET request with a malicious parameter to inject arbitrary commands. These commands are executed with root privileges, allowing attackers to gain full control over the device. This poses a significant security risk to any device running this software.
