### Description

The update mechanism in Xtooltech Xtool AnyScan Android Application 4.40.40 and prior is insecure. The application downloads and extracts update packages containing executable code without performing a cryptographic integrity or authenticity check on their contents. An attacker who can control the update metadata can serve a malicious package, which the application will accept, extract, and later execute, leading to arbitrary code execution.
