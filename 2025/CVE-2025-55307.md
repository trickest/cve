### Description

An issue was discovered in Foxit PDF and Editor for Windows before 13.2 and 2025 before 2025.2. Opening a malicious PDF containing a crafted JavaScript call to search.query() with a crafted cDIPath parameter (e.g., "/") may cause an out-of-bounds read in internal path-parsing logic, potentially leading to information disclosure or memory corruption.
