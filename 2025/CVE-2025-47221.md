### Description

An arbitrary file write was found in Keyfactor SignServer versions prior to 7.3.2. The properties ARCHIVETODISK_FILENAME-PATTERN, ARCHIVETODISK_PATH_BASE, ARCHIVETODISK_PATH_PATTERN can be set to any path, even ones that will point to files that already exist. This vulnerability gives a user with admin access the possibility to write files in arbitrary directories in the server file system and potentially overwrite files accessible by the local user JBoss.
