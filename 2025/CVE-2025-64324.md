### Description

KubeVirt is a virtual machine management add-on for Kubernetes. The `hostDisk` feature in KubeVirt allows mounting a host file or directory owned by the user with UID 107 into a VM. However, prior to version 1.6.1 and 1.7.0, the implementation of this feature and more specifically the `DiskOrCreate` option (which creates a file if it doesn't exist) has a logic bug that allows an attacker to read and write arbitrary files owned by more privileged users on the host system. Versions 1.6.1 and 1.7.0 fix the issue.
