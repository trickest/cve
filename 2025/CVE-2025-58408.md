### Description

Software installed and run as a non-privileged user may conduct improper GPU system calls to trigger reads of stale data that can lead to kernel exceptions and write use-after-free.The Use After Free common weakness enumeration was chosen as the stale data can include handles to resources in which the reference counts can become unbalanced. This can lead to the premature destruction of a resource while in use.
