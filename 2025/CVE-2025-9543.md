### Description

The FlexTable  WordPress plugin before 3.19.2 does not sanitise and escape the imported links from Google Sheet cells, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup).
