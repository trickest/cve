### Description

The AI Feeds plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing capability check in the 'actualizador_git.php' file in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.11. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to download arbitrary GitHub repositories and overwrite plugin files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.
