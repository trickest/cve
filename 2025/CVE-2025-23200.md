### Description

librenms is a community-based GPL-licensed network monitoring system. Affected versions are subject to a stored XSS on the parameter: `ajax_form.php` -> param: state. Librenms versions up to 24.10.1 allow remote attackers to inject malicious scripts. When a user views or interacts with the page displaying the data, the malicious script executes immediately, leading to potential unauthorized actions or data exposure. This issue has been addressed in release version 24.11.0. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
