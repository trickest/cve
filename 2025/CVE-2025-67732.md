### Description

Dify is an open-source LLM app development platform. Prior to version 1.11.0, the API key is exposed in plaintext to the frontend, allowing non-administrator users to view and reuse it. This can lead to unauthorized access to third-party services, potentially consuming limited quotas. Version 1.11.0 fixes the issue.
