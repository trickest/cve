### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:smb: client: fix race with concurrent opens in rename(2)Besides sending the rename request to the server, the rename processalso involves closing any deferred close, waiting for outstanding I/Oto complete as well as marking all existing open handles as deleted toprevent them from deferring closes, which increases the race windowfor potential concurrent opens on the target file.Fix this by unhashing the dentry in advance to prevent any concurrentopens on the target.
