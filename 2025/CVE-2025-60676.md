### Description

An unauthenticated command injection vulnerability exists in the D-Link DIR-878A1 router firmware FW101B04.bin. The vulnerability occurs in the 'SetNetworkSettings' functionality of prog.cgi, where the 'IPAddress' and 'SubnetMask' parameters are directly concatenated into shell commands executed via system(). An attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely without authentication by sending a specially crafted HTTP request, leading to arbitrary command execution on the device.
