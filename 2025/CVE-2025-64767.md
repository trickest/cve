### Description

hpke-js is a Hybrid Public Key Encryption (HPKE) module built on top of Web Cryptography API. Prior to version 1.7.5, the public SenderContext Seal() API has a race condition which allows for the same AEAD nonce to be re-used for multiple Seal() calls. This can lead to complete loss of Confidentiality and Integrity of the produced messages. This issue has been patched in version 1.7.5.
