### Description

Plesk Obsidian versions 8.0.1 through 18.0.73 are vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability exists in the get_password.php endpoint, where a crafted request containing a malicious payload can cause the affected web interface to continuously reload, rendering the service unavailable to legitimate users. An attacker can exploit this issue remotely without authentication, resulting in a persistent availability impact on the affected Plesk Obsidian instance.
