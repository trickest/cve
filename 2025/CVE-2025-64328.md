### Description

FreePBX Endpoint Manager is a module for managing telephony endpoints in FreePBX systems. In versions 17.0.2.36 and above before 17.0.3, the filestore module within the Administrative interface is vulnerable to a post-authentication command injection by an authenticated known user via the testconnection -> check_ssh_connect() function. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to obtain remote access to the system as an asterisk user. This issue is fixed in version 17.0.3.
