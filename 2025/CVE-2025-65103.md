### Description

OpenSTAManager is an open source management software for technical assistance and invoicing. Prior to version 2.9.5, an authenticated SQL Injection vulnerability in the API allows any user, regardless of permission level, to execute arbitrary SQL queries. By manipulating the display parameter in an API request, an attacker can exfiltrate, modify, or delete any data in the database, leading to a full system compromise. This issue has been patched in version 2.9.5.
