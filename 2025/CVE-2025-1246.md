### Description

Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer vulnerability in Arm Ltd Bifrost GPU Userspace Driver, Arm Ltd Valhall GPU Userspace Driver, Arm Ltd Arm 5th Gen GPU Architecture Userspace Driver allows a non-privileged user process to perform valid GPU processing operations, including via WebGL or WebGPU, to access outside of buffer bounds.This issue affects Bifrost GPU Userspace Driver: from r18p0 through r49p3, from r50p0 through r51p0; Valhall GPU Userspace Driver: from r28p0 through r49p3, from r50p0 through r54p0; Arm 5th Gen GPU Architecture Userspace Driver: from r41p0 through r49p3, from r50p0 through r54p0.
