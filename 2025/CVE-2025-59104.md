### Description

With physical access to the device and enough time an attacker is able to solder test leads to the debug footprint (or use the 6-Pin tag-connect cable). Thus, the attacker gains access to the bootloader, where the kernel command line can be changed. An attacker is able to gain a root shell through this vulnerability.
