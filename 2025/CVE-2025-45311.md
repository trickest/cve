### Description

Insecure permissions in fail2ban-client v0.11.2 allows attackers with limited sudo privileges to perform arbitrary operations as root. NOTE: this is disputed by multiple parties because the action for a triggered rule can legitimately be an arbitrary operation as root. Thus, the software is behaving in accordance with its intended privilege model.
