### Description

SuiteCRM is an open-source, enterprise-ready Customer Relationship Management (CRM) software application. In versions 8.6.0 through 8.9.0, there is an authenticated, blind (time-based) SQL-injection inside the appMetadata-operation of the GraphQL-API. This allows extraction of arbitrary data from the database, and does not require administrative access. This issue is fixed in version 8.9.1.
