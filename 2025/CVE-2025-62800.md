### Description

FastMCP is the standard framework for building MCP applications. Versions prior to 2.13.0 have a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability in the OAuth client callback page (oauth_callback.py) where unescaped user-controlled values are inserted into the generated HTML, allowing arbitrary JavaScript execution in the callback server origin. The issue is fixed in version 2.13.0.
