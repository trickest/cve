### Description

An RPC service, which is part of exos 9300, is reachable on port 4000, run by the process FSMobilePhoneInterface.exe. This service is used for interprocess communication between services and the Kaba exos 9300 GUI, containing status information about the Access Managers. Interacting with the service does not require any authentication. Therefore, it is possible to send arbitrary status information about door contacts etc. without prior authentication.
