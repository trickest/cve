### Description

The WP Directory Kit plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass in all versions up to, and including, 1.4.4 due to incorrect implementation of the authentication algorithm in the "wdk_generate_auto_login_link" function. This is due to the feature using a cryptographically weak token generation mechanism. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to gain administrative access and achieve full site takeover via the auto-login endpoint with a predictable token.
