### Description

The Image Gallery – Photo Grid & Video Gallery plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion due to insufficient file path validation in the ajax_import_file function in all versions up to, and including, 2.12.28. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with author-level access and above, to move arbitrary image files on the server.
