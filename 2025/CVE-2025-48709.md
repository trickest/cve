### Description

BMC Control-M/Server 9.0.21.300 displays cleartext database credentials in process lists and logs. An authenticated attacker with shell access could observe these credentials and use them to log in to the database server. For example, when Control-M/Server on Windows has a database connection on, it runs 'DBUStatus.exe' frequently, which then calls 'dbu_connection_details.vbs' with the username, password, database hostname, and port written in cleartext, which can be seen in event and process logs in two separate locations. Fixed in PACTV.9.0.21.307.
