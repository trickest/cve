### Description

PagerDuty Runbook through 2025-06-12 exposes stored secrets directly in the webpage DOM at the configuration page. Although these secrets appear masked as password fields, the actual secret values are present in the page source and can be revealed by simply modifying the input field type from "password" to "text" using browser developer tools. This vulnerability is exploitable by administrative users who have access to the configuration page.
