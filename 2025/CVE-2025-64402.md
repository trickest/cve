### Description

Apache OpenOffice documents can contain links. A missing Authorization vulnerability in Apache OpenOffice allowed an attacker to craft a document that would cause external links to be loaded without prompt. In the affected versions of Apache OpenOffice, documents that used "OLE objects" linked to external files would load the contents of those files without prompting the user for permission to do so.This issue affects Apache OpenOffice: through 4.1.15.Users are recommended to upgrade to version 4.1.16, which fixes the issue.
