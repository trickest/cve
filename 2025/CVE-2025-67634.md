### Description

The CISA Software Acquisition Guide Supplier Response Web Tool before 2025-12-11 was vulnerable to cross-site scripting via text fields. If an attacker could convince a user to import a specially-crafted JSON file, the Tool would load JavaScript from the file into the page. The JavaScript would execute in the context of the user's browser when the user submits the page (clicks 'Next').
