### Description

Ilevia EVE X1 Server firmware versions ≤ 4.7.18.0.eden contain an insecure hashing algorithm vulnerability. The product stores passwords using the MD5 hash function without applying a per‑password salt. Because MD5 is a fast, unsalted hash, an attacker who obtains the password database can efficiently perform offline dictionary, rainbow‑table, or brute‑force attacks to recover the original passwords. Ilevia has declined to service this vulnerability, and recommends that customers not expose port 8080 to the internet.
