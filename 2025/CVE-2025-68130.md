### Description

tRPC allows users to build and consume fully typesafe APIs without schemas or code generation. Starting in version 10.27.0 and prior to versions 10.45.3 and 11.8.0, a A prototype pollution vulnerability exists in `@trpc/server`'s `formDataToObject` function, which is used by the Next.js App Router adapter. An attacker can pollute `Object.prototype` by submitting specially crafted FormData field names, potentially leading to authorization bypass, denial of service, or other security impacts. Note that this vulnerability is only present when using `experimental_caller` / `experimental_nextAppDirCaller`. Versions 10.45.3 and 11.8.0 fix the issue.
